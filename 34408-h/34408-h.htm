<p>Socrates, a Greek ecclesiastic of the fifth century, and several other
Byzantine writers, inform us, that Ulfilas, belonging to a family of
Cappadocia, having been carried away captive by the Goths, when they
invaded that country in A.D. 366, was subsequently elevated to the
episcopal dignity in his new country, which had been converted to
Christianity; that he was sent as a legate to the Emperor Valens, at
Constantinople, in the year 377, to ask for a province of the empire,
as a refuge for the Goths from the Huns, by whom they had been
conquered; that Ulfilas obtained permission for them to settle in
Moesia, on the right bank of the Danube; and that, in order to confirm
them in the Christian faith, he translated the Old and New Testaments
into the Gothic language, and invented for that purpose an especial
alphabet; which, from this circumstance, has been named the alphabet
of Ulfilas, or the alphabet of the Goths of Moesia. This translation
of the Bible is the oldest existing literary monument in the Germanic
languages. The principal manuscript is the Codex Argenteus, written in
silver characters on a purple ground. The accompanying facsimile is
from the Gospel according to St. Mark, chapter VII., beginning in the
3d verse at the words "Jews eat not," and ending in the 7th verse at
"In vain do they worship me, teaching...."</p>

<h2><a name="TORU_DUTT" id="TORU_DUTT"></a>TORU DUTT</h2>

<h4>(1856-1877)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capi.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap">n 1874 there appeared in the Bengal Magazine an essay upon
Leconte de Lisle, which showed not only an unusual knowledge
of French literature, but also decided literary qualities.
The essayist was Toru Dutt, a Hindu girl of eighteen, daughter
of Govin Chunder Dutt, for many years a justice of the peace at
Calcutta. The family belonged to the high-caste cultivated Hindus,
and Toru's education was conducted on broad lines. Her work frequently
discloses charming pictures of the home life that filled the
old garden house at Calcutta. Here it is easy to see the studious
child poring over French, German, and English lexicons, reading
every book she could lay hold of, hearing from her mother's lips those
old legends of her race which had been woven into the poetry of
native bards long before the civilization of modern Europe existed.
In her thirteenth year Toru and her younger sister were sent to
study for a few months in France, and thence to attend lectures at
Cambridge and to travel in England. A memory of this visit appears
in Toru's little poem, 'Near Hastings,' which shows the impressionable
nature of the Indian girl, so sensitive to the romance of an alien
race, and so appreciative of her friendly welcome to English soil.</p>

<p>After four years' travel in Europe the Dutts returned to India to
resume their student life, and Toru began to learn Sanskrit. She
showed great aptitude for the French language and a strong liking
for the French character, and she made a special study of French
romantic poetry. Her essays on Leconte de Lisle and Jos&eacute;phin Soulary,
and a series of English translations of poetry, were the fruit of
her labor. The translations, including specimens from B&eacute;ranger, Th&eacute;ophile
Gautier, Fran&ccedil;ois Copp&eacute;e, Sully-Prud'homme, and other popular
writers, were collected in 1876 under the title 'A Sheaf Gleaned
in French Fields.' A few copies found their way into Europe, and
both French and English reviewers recognized the value of the harvest
of this clear-sighted gleaner. One critic called these poems, in
which Toru so faithfully reproduced the spirit of one alien tongue in
the forms of another, transmutations rather than translations.</p>

<p>But marvelous as is the mastery shown over the subtleties of
thought and the difficulties of translation, the achievement remains
that of acquirement rather than of inspiration. But Toru's English
renditions of the native Indian legends, called 'Ancient Ballads of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5076" id="Page_5076">[Pg 5076]</a></span>
Hindustan,' give a sense of great original power. Selected from
much completed work left unpublished at her too early death, these
poems are revelations of the Eastern religious thought, which loves
to clothe itself in such forms of mystical beauty as haunt the memory
and charm the fancy. But in these translations it is touched by the
spirit of the new faith which Toru had adopted. The poems remain,
however, essentially Indian. The glimpses of lovely landscape, the
shining temples, the greening gloom of the jungle, the pink flush of
the dreamy atmosphere, are all of the East, as is the philosophic
calm that breathes through the verses. The most beautiful of the
ballads is perhaps that of 'Savitri,' the king's daughter who by love
wins back her husband after he has passed the gates of death.
Another, 'Sindher,' re-tells the old story of that king whose great
power is unavailing to avert the penalty which follows the breaking
of the Vedic law, even though it was broken in ignorance. Still
another, 'Prehlad,' reveals that insight into things spiritual which
characterizes the true seer or "called of God." Two charming
legends, 'Jogadhya Uma,' and 'Buttoo,' full of the pastoral simplicity
of the early Aryan life, and a few miscellaneous poems, complete
this volume upon which Toru's fame will rest.</p>

<p>A posthumous novel written in French makes up the sum of her
contribution to letters. 'Le Journal de Mlle. D'Arvers' was found
completed among her posthumous papers. It is a romance of modern
French life, whose motive is the love of two brothers for the same
girl. The tragic element dominates the story, and the author has
managed the details with extraordinary ease without sacrificing either
dignity or dramatic effect. The story was edited by Mademoiselle
Bader, a correspondent of Toru, and her sole acquaintance among
European authors. In 1878, the year after the poet's death, appeared
a second edition of 'A Sheaf Gleaned in French Fields' containing
forty-three additional poems, with a brief biographical sketch written
by her father. The many translators of the 'Sakoontala' and of
other Indian dramas show how difficult it is for the Western mind to
express the indefinable spirituality of temper that fills ancient Hindu
poetry. This remarkable quality Toru wove unconsciously into her
English verse, making it seem not exotic but complementary, an
echo of that far-off age when the genius of the two races was one.</p>

<span class="i0">A fair young woman with large eyes,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Intruding curls, by breezes fanned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blown across her brows and face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And asked the price; which when she heard<br /></span>

<h2><a name="JOHN_S_DWIGHT" id="JOHN_S_DWIGHT"></a>JOHN S. DWIGHT</h2>

<h4>(1813-1893)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capj.png" width="80" height="80" alt="J" title="J" />
</div><p class="dropcap">ohn Sullivan Dwight was born in Boston, Massachusetts,
May 13th, 1813. After graduation at Harvard in 1832, he
studied at the Divinity School, and for two years was pastor
of a Unitarian church in Northampton, Massachusetts. He then became
interested in founding the famous Brook Farm community,
which furnished Hawthorne with the background for 'The Blithedale
Romance'; and he is mentioned in the preface to this book with
Ripley, Dana, Channing, Parker, etc. This was a "community"
scheme, undertaken by joint ownership in a farm in West Roxbury
near Boston; associated with the names of Hawthorne, Emerson,
George William Curtis, and C.A. Dana,&mdash;a scheme which Emerson
called "a perpetual picnic, a French Revolution in small, an age of
reason in a patty-pan." This community existed seven years, and to
quote again from Emerson,&mdash;"In Brook Farm was this peculiarity,
that there was no head. In every family is the father; in every factory
a foreman; in a shop a master; in a boat the skipper; but in
this Farm no authority; each was master or mistress of their actions;
happy, hapless anarchists."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Dwight edited The Harbinger, a periodical published by
that community; taught languages and music, besides doing his share
of the manual labor. In 1848 he returned to Boston and engaged in
literature and musical criticism; and in 1852 he established Dwight's
Journal of Music, which he edited for thirty years. Many of his best
essays appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, and he contributed to
various periodicals.</p>

<p>He was one of the pioneers of scholarly, intelligent, original, and
literary musical criticism in America, and he possessed fine general
attainments and a distinct style. It is because of his clear
perception of the indispensableness of the arts&mdash;and especially of the
art of music&mdash;to life, and because of his clear statement of their
vital relationship, that his work belongs to literature.</p>

<h3><a name="MUSIC_AS_A_MEANS_OF_CULTURE" id="MUSIC_AS_A_MEANS_OF_CULTURE"></a>MUSIC AS A MEANS OF CULTURE</h3>

<h4>From the Atlantic Monthly, 1870, by permission of Houghton, Mifflin and Company</h4>

<p>We as a democratic people, a great mixed people of all races,
overrunning a vast continent, need music even more than others. We
need some ever-present, ever-welcome influence that shall insensibly
tone down our self-asserting and aggressive manners, round off the
sharp, offensive angularity of character, subdue and harmonize the
free and ceaseless conflict of opinions, warm out the genial
individual humanity of each and every unit of society, lest he become
a mere member of a party, or a sharer of business or fashion. This
rampant liberty will rush to its own ruin, unless there shall be found
some gentler, harmonizing, humanizing culture, such as may pervade
whole masses with a fine enthusiasm, a sweet sense of reverence for
something far above us, beautiful and pure; awakening some ideality in
every soul, and often lifting us out of the hard hopeless prose of
daily life. We need this beautiful corrective of our crudities. Our
radicalism will pull itself up by the roots, if it do not cultivate
the instinct of reverence. The first impulse of freedom is
centrifugal,&mdash;to fly off the handle,&mdash;unless it be restrained by a no
less free impassioned love of order. We need to be so enamored of the
divine idea of unity, that that alone&mdash;the enriching of that&mdash;shall be
the real motive for assertion of our individuality. What shall so
temper and tone down our "fierce democracy"? It must be something
better, lovelier, more congenial to human nature than mere stern
prohibition, cold Puritanic "Thou shalt <i>not</i>!" What can so quickly
magnetize a people into this harmonic mood as music? Have we not seen
it, felt it?</p>

<p>The hard-working, jaded millions need expansion, need the
rejuvenating, the ennobling experience of joy. Their toil, their
church, their creed perhaps, their party livery, and very vote, are
narrowing; they need to taste, to breathe a larger, freer life. Has it
not come to thousands, while they have listened to or joined their
voices in some thrilling chorus that made the heavens seem to open and
come down? The governments of the Old World do much to make the people
cheerful and contented; here it is all <i>laissez-faire</i>, each for
himself, in an ever keener strife of competition. We must look very
much to music to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5086" id="Page_5086">[Pg 5086]</a></span> this good work for us; we are open to that
appeal; we can forget ourselves in that; we blend in joyous fellowship
when we can sing together; perhaps quite as much so when we can listen
together to a noble orchestra of instruments interpreting the highest
inspirations of a master. The higher and purer the character and kind
of music, the more of real genius there is in it, the deeper will this
influence be.</p>

<p>Judge of what can be done, by what already, within our own experience,
has been done and daily is done. Think what the children in our
schools are getting, through the little that they learn of vocal
music,&mdash;elasticity of spirit, joy in harmonious co-operation, in the
blending of each happy life in others; a rhythmical instinct of order
and of measure in all movement; a quickening of ear and sense, whereby
they will grow up susceptible to music, as well as with some use of
their own voices, so that they may take part in it; for from these
spacious nurseries (loveliest flower gardens, apple orchards in full
bloom, say, on their annual <i>f&ecirc;te</i> days) shall our future choirs and
oratorio choruses be replenished with good sound material....</p>

<p>We esteem ourselves the freest people on this planet; yet perhaps we
have as little real freedom as any other, for we are the slaves of our
own feverish enterprise, and of a barren theory of discipline, which
would fain make us virtuous to a fault through abstinence from very
life. We are afraid to give ourselves up to the free and happy
instincts of our nature. All that is not pursuit of advancement in
some good, conventional, approved way of business, or politics, or
fashion, or intellectual reputation, or professed religion, we count
waste. We lack <i>geniality</i>; nor do we as a people understand the
meaning of the word. We ought to learn it practically of our Germans.
It comes of the same root with the word <i>genius</i>. Genius is the
spontaneous principle; it is free and happy in its work; it is artist
and not drudge; its whole activity is reconciliation of the heartiest
pleasure with the purest loyalty to conscience, with the most holy,
universal, and disinterested ends. Genius, as Beethoven gloriously
illustrates in his Choral Symphony (indeed, in all his symphonies),
finds the keynote and solution of the problem of the highest state in
"Joy," taking his text from Schiller's Hymn. Now, all may not be
geniuses in the sense that we call Shakespeare, Mozart, Raphael, men
of genius. But all should be partakers of this spontaneous, free, and
happy method of genius; all should live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5087" id="Page_5087">[Pg 5087]</a></span> childlike, genial lives, and
not wear all the time the consequential livery of their unrelaxing
business, nor the badge of party and profession, in every line and
feature of their faces. This genial, childlike faculty of social
enjoyment, this happy art of life, is just what our countrymen may
learn from the social "Liedertafel" and the summer singing-festivals
of which the Germans are so fond. There is no element of national
character which we so much need; and there is no class of citizens
whom we should be more glad to adopt and own than those who set us
such examples. So far as it is a matter of culture, it is through art
chiefly that the desiderated genial era must be ushered in. The
Germans have the sentiment of art, the feeling of the beautiful in
art, and consequently in nature, more developed than we have. Above
all, music offers itself as the most available, most popular, most
influential of the fine arts,&mdash;music, which is the art and language of
the feelings, the sentiments, the spiritual instincts of the soul; and
so becomes a universal language, tending to unite and blend and
harmonize all who may come within its sphere.</p>

<p>Such civilizing, educating power has music for society at large. Now,
in the finer sense of culture, such as we look for in more private and
select "society," as it is called, music in the salon, in the small
chamber concert, where congenial spirits are assembled in its
name&mdash;good music of course&mdash;does it not create a finer sphere of
social sympathy and courtesy? Does it not better mold the tone and
manners from within than any imitative "fashion" from without? What
society, upon the whole, is quite so sweet, so satisfactory, so
refined, as the best musical society, if only Mozart, Mendelssohn,
Franz, Chopin, set the tone! The finer the kind of music heard or made
together, the better the society. This bond of union only reaches the
few; coarser, meaner, more prosaic natures are not drawn to it. Wealth
and fashion may not dictate who shall be of it. Here congenial spirits
meet in a way at once free, happy, and instructive, meet with an
object which insures "society"; whereas so-called society, as such, is
often aimless, vague, modifying and fatiguing, for the want of any
subject-matter. Here one gets ideas of beauty which are not mere
arbitrary fashions, ugly often to the eye of taste. Here you may
escape vulgarity by a way not vulgar in itself, like that of fashion,
which makes wealth and family and means of dress its passports. Here
you can be as exclusive as you please, by the soul's light, not
wronging any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5088" id="Page_5088">[Pg 5088]</a></span> one; here learn gentle manners, and the quiet ease and
courtesy with which cultivated people move, without in the same
process learning insincerity.</p>

<p>Of course the same remarks apply to similar sincere reunions in the
name of any other art, or of poetry. But music is the most social of
them all, even if each listener find nothing set down to his part (or
even hers!) but <i>tacet</i>.</p>

<p>We have fancied ourselves entertaining a musical house together, but
we must leave it with no time to make report or picture out the scene.
Now, could we only enter the chamber, the inner sanctum, the private
inner life of a thoroughly musical person, one who is wont to <i>live</i>
in music! Could we know him in his solitude! (You can only know him in
yourself, unless he be a poet and creator in his art, and bequeath
himself in that form in his works for any who know how to read.) If
the best of all society is musical society, we go further and say: The
sweetest of all solitude is when one is alone with music. One gets the
best of music, the sincerest part, when he is alone. Our
poet-philosopher has told us to secure solitude at any cost; there's
nothing which we can so ill afford to do without. It is a great vice
of our society, that it provides for and disposes to so little
solitude, ignoring the fact that there is more loneliness in company
than out of it. Now, to a musical person, in the mood of it, in the
sweet hours by himself, comes music as the nearest friend, nearer and
dearer than ever before; and he soon finds that he never was in such
good company. I doubt if symphony of Beethoven, opera of Mozart,
Passion Music of Bach, was ever so enjoyed or felt in grandest public
rendering, as one may feel it while he recalls its outline by himself
at his piano (even if he be a slow and bungling reader and may get it
out by piecemeal). I doubt if such an one can carry home from the
performance, in presence of the applauding crowd, nearly so much as he
may take to it from such inward, private preparation.</p>

<p>Are you alone? What spirits can you summon up to fill the vacancy, and
people it with life and love and beauty! Take down the volume of
sonatas, the arrangement of the great Symphony, the recorded reveries
of Chopin, the songs of Schubert, Schumann, Franz, or even the
chorals, with the harmony of Bach, in which the four parts blend their
several individual melodies together in such loving service of the
whole, that the plain people's tune becomes a germ unfolding into
endless wealth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5089" id="Page_5089">[Pg 5089]</a></span> and beauty of meaning; and you have the very essence
of all prayer, and praise, and gratitude, as if you were a worshiper
in the ideal church. Nothing like music, then, to banish the benumbing
ghost of ennui. It lends secret sympathy, relief, expression, to all
one's moods, loves, longings, sorrows; comes nearer to the soul or to
the secret wound than any friend or healing sunshine from without. It
nourishes and feeds the hidden springs of hope and love and faith;
renews the old conviction of life's springtime,&mdash;that the world is
ruled by love, that God is good, that beauty is a divine end of life,
and not a snare and an illusion. It floods out of sight the unsightly,
muddy grounds of life's petty, anxious, doubting moments, and makes
immortality a present fact, lived in and realized. It locks the door
against the outer world of discords, contradictions, importunities,
beneath the notice of a soul so richly occupied: lets "Fate knock at
the door" (as Beethoven said in explanation of his symphony),&mdash;Fate
and the pursuing Furies,&mdash;and even welcomes them, and turns them into
gracious goddesses,&mdash;Eumenides! Music, in this way, is a marvelous
elixir to keep off old age. Youth returns in solitary hours with
Beethoven and Mozart. Touching the chords of the 'Moonlight Sonata,'
the old man is once more a lover; with the <i>andante</i> of the 'Pastoral
Symphony' he loiters by the shady brookside, hand in hand with his
fresh heart's first angel. You are past the sentimental age, yet you
can weep alone in music,&mdash;not weep exactly, but find outlet more
expressive and more worthy of your manly faith.</p>

<p>A great grief comes, an inconsolable bereavement, a humiliating,
paralyzing reverse, a blow of Fate, giving the lie to your best plans
and bringing your best powers into discredit with yourself; then you
are best prepared and best entitled to receive the secret visitations
of these tuneful goddesses and muses.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who never ate his bread in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows you not, ye heavenly powers!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So sings the German poet. It is the want of inward, deep experience,
it is innocence of sorrow and of trial, more than the lack of any
special cultivation of musical taste and knowledge, that debars many
people&mdash;naturally most young people, and all who are what we call
shallow natures&mdash;from the feeling and enjoyment of many of the truest,
deepest, and most heavenly of all the works of music. Take the Passion
Music of Bach, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5090" id="Page_5090">[Pg 5090]</a></span> instance; if you can sit down alone at your piano
and decipher strains and pieces of it when you <i>need</i> such music, you
shall find that in its quiet quaintness, its sincerity and tenderness,
its abstinence from all striving for effect, it speaks to you and
entwines itself about your heart, like the sweetest, deepest verses in
the Bible; when "the soul muses till the fire burns."</p>

<p>Such a panacea is this art for loneliness. But sometimes too it may
intensify the sense of loneliness, only for more heavenly relief at
last. Think of the deep composer, of lonely, sad Beethoven, wreaking
his pain upon expression in those impatient chords and modulations,
putting his sorrows into sonatas, and wringing triumph always out of
all! Look at him as he was then,&mdash;morose, they say, and lonely and
tormented; look where he is now, as the whole world knows him, feels
him, seeks him for its joy and inspiration&mdash;and who can doubt of
immortality?</p>

<p>Now, in such private solace, in such solitary joys, is there not
culture? Can one rise from such communings with the good spirits of
the tone-world and go out, without new peace, new faith, new hope, and
good-will in his soul? He goes forth in the spirit of reconciliation
and of patience, however much he may hate the wrong he sees about him,
or however little he accept authorities and creeds that make war on
his freedom. The man who has tasted such life, and courted it till he
has become acclimated in it, whether he be of this party or that, or
none at all; whether he be believer or "heretic," conservative or
radical, follower of Christ by name or "Free Religionist,"&mdash;belongs to
the harmonic and anointed body-guard of peace, fraternity, good-will;
his instincts have all caught the rhythm of that holy march; the good
genius leads, he has but to follow cheerfully and humbly. For somehow
the minutest fibres, the infinitesimal atoms of his being, have got
magnetized as it were into a loyal, positive direction towards the
pole-star of unity; he has grown attuned to a believing, loving mood,
just as the body of a violin, the walls of a music hall, by much
music-making become gradually seasoned into smooth vibration.</p>

<h4>(1837-)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capg.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="G" title="G" />
</div><p class="dropcap">eorg Ebers, distinguished as an Egyptian archaeologist and as
a historical novelist, was born in Berlin in 1837. At ten
years of age he was sent to school in Keilhau, where under
the direction of Froebel he was taught the delights of nature and the
pleasure of study. His university career at G&ouml;ttingen was interrupted
by a long and serious illness. During his convalescence he pursued
with avidity his study of Egyptian arch&aelig;ology, and with neither dictionary
nor grammar to help him in the mastery of hieroglyphics, he
acquired to some degree this ancient language. Later, under the
learned Lepsius, he became a thorough and brilliant scholar in the
science which is his specialty. It was at this epoch that he wrote
'An Egyptian Princess,' for the purpose of realizing to himself a
period which he was studying. Thirteen years later his second work,
'Uarda' was published. When restored to health, he launched himself
with enthusiasm on the life of a university professor. He taught
for a time at Jena, and in 1870 removed to Leipsic. He has made
several journeys into Egypt, sharing his experiences with the public.</p>

<p>'The Egyptian Princess' is Ebers's most representative romance.
It is perhaps the subtle quality of popularity, rather than exceptional
merit, which has insured its success. The scene of the story is laid
at the time when Egypt drew its last free breath, unconscious that
at the very height of its intellectual vigor its national life was to be
cut off; the time when Amasis held the throne of the Pharaohs, and
Cambyses was king of Persia. 'Uarda' gives a picture of Egypt
under one of the Rameses. 'Homo Sum,' a tale of the desert anchorites
in the fourth century, is filled with the spirit of the early Christians.
In the story of 'Die Schwestern' (The Sisters) Ebers takes the
reader to Memphis, the temple of Serapis, and the palace of the
Ptolemies. The ethical element enters largely into the novel 'Der
Kaiser' (The Emperor), of Christianity in the time of Hadrian.</p>

<p>In the 'Frau B&uuml;rgermeisterin' (The Burgomaster's Wife), Ebers
leaves behind him the world of antiquity, and deals with the heroic
struggle against the Spanish rule made in 1547 by the city of Leyden.
'Gred,' a long and quiet novel, most carefully executed, is a
minute picture of middle-class N&uuml;rnberg, some centuries ago. 'Ein
Wort' (A Word: Only a Word) also stands apart from the historical
romances. It is a psychological and ethical story, working out the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5092" id="Page_5092">[Pg 5092]</a></span>development of inconspicuous character. Both in 'Serapis' and
'The Bride of the Nile,' the victory of Christianity over heathenism
is celebrated. Not less interesting than his fiction is his book of
travels called 'Durch Gosen zum Sinai' (Through Goshen to Sinai).
In 1889, on account of his health, Ebers resigned his professorship.
He now passes his winters in Munich, where his life is that of a
scholar and a writer.</p>

<h3><a name="BABYLON" id="BABYLON"></a>THE ARRIVAL AT BABYLON</h3>

<h4>From 'An Egyptian Princess'</h4>

<p>Seven weeks later, a long line of chariots and riders of every
description wound along the great highway that led from
the west to Babylon, the gigantic city which could be seen
from a long distance.</p>

<p>Nitetis, the Egyptian princess, sat in a gilt four-wheeled
chariot, called a "Harmamaxa." The cushions were covered with
gold brocade; the roof was supported by wooden columns; its
sides could be closed by means of curtains.</p>

<p>Her companions, the Persian nobles, the dethroned King of
Lydia and his son, rode by the side of her chariot. Fifty carriages
and six hundred sumpter-horses followed, and a regiment
of Persian soldiers on splendid horses preceded the procession.</p>

<p>The road lay along the Euphrates, through luxuriant fields of
wheat, barley, and sesame, which yielded two or even three hundredfold.
Slender date-palms, with heavy clusters of fruit, stood
in the fields, which were intersected in all directions by canals
and conduits. Although it was winter, the sun shone warm and
clear in the cloudless sky. The mighty river was crowded with
barges and boats, which brought the produce of the Armenian
highlands to the Mesopotamian plain, and forwarded to Babylon
the greater part of the wares which were brought to Thapsacus
from Greece.</p>

<p>Engines, pumps, and water-wheels poured refreshing moisture
on the fields and plantations along the banks, which were dotted
with numerous villages. Everything indicated that the capital of
a civilized and well-governed country was close at hand.</p>

<p>The carriage and suite of Nitetis stopped before a long
building of brick covered with bitumen, by the side of which
grew numerous plane-trees. Croesus was helped from his horse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5093" id="Page_5093">[Pg 5093]</a></span>
approached the carriage of the Egyptian princess, and cried to
her:&mdash;"We have reached the last station-house. The high tower
that stands out against the horizon is the famous tower of Bel,
like your Pyramids one of the greatest achievements of mortal
hands. Before the sun sets we shall reach the brazen gates of
Babylon. Permit me to help you from the carriage, and to send
your women to you into the house. To-day you must dress
yourself according to the custom of Persian queens, so that you
may be pleasant in the eyes of Cambyses. In a few hours you
will stand before your husband. How pale you are! See that
your women skillfully paint joyous excitement on your cheeks.
The first impression is often decisive, and this is the case with
your future husband, more than with any one else. If, as I do
not doubt, you please him at first sight, you have won his heart
forever. If you displease him, he will, in accordance with his
rough habits, scarcely deign to look on you again with kindness.
Courage, my daughter. Above all things, remember what I have
taught you."</p>

<p>Nitetis wiped away a tear, and returned:&mdash;"How shall I thank you for
all your kindness, Croesus, my second father, my protector and
adviser! Oh, do not ever desert me! When the path of my poor life
passes through sorrow and grief, remain my guide and protector, as you
have been during this long journey over dangerous mountain passes.
Thank you, my father, thank you a thousand times."</p>

<p>With these words, the girl put her beautiful arms round the old man's
neck and kissed him like an affectionate daughter.</p>

<p>When she entered the court of the gloomy house, a man came towards
her, followed by a train of Asiatic serving-women. The leader, the
chief eunuch, one of the most important Persian court officials, was
tall and stout. There was a sweet smile on his beardless face;
valuable rings hung from his ears; his arms and legs, his neck, his
long womanish garments, were covered with gold ornaments, and his
stiff artificial curls were surrounded by a purple fillet, and sent
forth a pungent odor. Boges, for this was the eunuch's name, bowed
respectfully to the Egyptian and said, holding his fleshy hand covered
with rings before his mouth:&mdash;"Cambyses, the ruler of the world, sends
me to meet you, O queen, that I may refresh your heart with the dew of
his greetings. He further sends to you through me, his poorest slave,
the garments of Persian women, that you may approach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5094" id="Page_5094">[Pg 5094]</a></span> the gate of the
Ach&aelig;menid&aelig; in Median dress, as beseems the wife of the greatest of
rulers. These women your servants await your commands. They will
transform you from an Egyptian emerald into a Persian diamond." Boges
drew back, and with a condescending movement of his hand allowed the
host of the inn to present the princess with a most tastefully
arranged basket of fruit.</p>

<p>Nitetis thanked both men with friendly words, entered the house, and
tearfully put off the robes of her home; the thick plait, the mark of
an Egyptian princess, was unfastened, and strange hands clad her in
Median fashion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her companions commanded a meal to be prepared.
Nimble servants fetched chairs, tables, and golden utensils from
the wagon; the cooks bustled about, and were so ready and eager
to help each other that soon, as if by magic, a splendidly laid
table where nothing was wanting, down to the very flowers,
awaited the hungry travelers.</p>

<p>The same luxury had been displayed during the whole journey, for the
sumpter-horses that followed the royal travelers carried every
imaginable convenience, from gold-woven water-proof tents down to
silver footstools, and the carts that accompanied them bore bakers,
cooks, cup-bearers, carvers, men to prepare ointment, wreath-winders,
and hair-dressers.</p>

<p>Well-appointed inns were established at regular intervals along the
high-road. Here the horses that had fallen on the way were replaced by
fresh ones, shady trees offered a pleasant shelter from the heat of
the sun, and on the mountains the fires of the inns protected the
traveler from cold and snow.</p>

<p>The Persian inns, which resembled our post-houses, were first
established by Cyrus the Great, who sought to shorten the enormous
distances between the different parts of his realm by means of
well-kept roads. He had also organized a regular postal service. At
every station the riders with their knapsacks found substitutes on
fresh horses ready for instant departure, who, after receiving the
letters which were to be forwarded, galloped off post-haste, and when
they reached the next inn threw their knapsacks to other riders who
stood in readiness. These couriers were called Angares, and were
considered the swiftest horsemen in the world.</p>

<p>When the company, who had been joined by Boges the
eunuch, rose from table, the door of the inn opened. A long-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5095" id="Page_5095">[Pg 5095]</a></span>drawn
sigh of admiration was heard, for Nitetis stood before the
Persians in the splendid Median court dress, proudly exultant in
the consciousness of her beauty, and yet suffused with blushes at
her friends' astonishment.</p>

<p>The servants involuntarily prostrated themselves in the Asiatic
manner, but the noble Ach&aelig;menid&aelig; bowed low and reverently.
It was as if the princess had laid aside all shyness with the simple
dress of her home, and assumed the pride and dignity of a
queen with the silken garments, heavy with gold and jewels, of
a Persian princess.</p>

<p>The deep respect which had just been shown her seemed to
please her. With a condescending movement of her hand she
thanked her admiring friends; then she turned to the chief
eunuch and said to him kindly but proudly:&mdash;"You have done
your duty. I am not dissatisfied with the robes and the slaves
you have provided for me. I shall duly praise your care to my
husband. Meanwhile, receive this golden chain as a sign of my
gratitude."</p>

<p>The powerful overseer of the king's wives kissed her hand
and silently accepted the gift. None of his charges had yet
treated him with such pride. All the wives whom Cambyses had
owned till now were Asiatics, and as they were acquainted with
the full power of the chief eunuch, they were accustomed to do
all they could to win his favor by means of flattery and submission.</p>

<p>Boges again bowed low to Nitetis; but without paying any
further attention to him, she turned to Croesus and said in a low
tone:&mdash;"I cannot thank you, my gracious friend, with word or
gift for what you have done for me; it will be owing to you
alone if my life at this court becomes, if not happy, at least
peaceful." Then she continued in a louder voice, audible to her
traveling companions:&mdash;"Take this ring, which has not left my
hand since our departure from Egypt. Its value is small, its
significance great. Pythagoras, the noblest of all the Greeks,
gave it to my mother when he came to Egypt to listen to the
wise teachings of our priests. She gave it to me when I left
home. There is a seven engraved on this simple turquoise.
This number, which is indivisible, represents the health of
body and soul, for nothing is less divisible than health. If but
a small portion of the body suffers, the whole body is ill; if
one evil thought nestles in our heart, the harmony of the soul is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5096" id="Page_5096">[Pg 5096]</a></span>
disturbed. Whenever you look at this seven, let it remind you
that I wish you perfect enjoyment of bodily health, and the continuance
of that benignity which makes you the most virtuous and therefore the
most healthy of men. No thanks, my father, for I should remain in your
debt though I should restore to Croesus the wealth of Croesus. Gyges,
take this Lydian lyre of ivory, and when its strings give forth music,
remember the giver. To you, Zopyrus, I give this chain, for I have
noticed that you are the most faithful friend of your friends, and we
Egyptians put bonds and ropes into the fair hands of our goddess of
love and friendship, beautiful Hathor, as a symbol of her binding
qualities. To you, Darius, the friend of Egyptian lore and the starry
firmament, I give for a keepsake this golden ring, on which you will
find the Zodiac engraved by a skillful hand. Bartja, my dear
brother-in-law, you shall receive the most precious treasure I
possess. Take this amulet of blue stone. My sister Tachot put it round
my neck when for the last time I pressed a kiss upon her lips before
we fell asleep. She told me this talisman would bring sweet happiness
in love to him who wore it. She wept as she spoke, Bartja. I do not
know what she was thinking of, but I hope I am carrying out her wish
when I lay this treasure in your hand. Think that Tachot is giving it
to you through me her sister, and think sometimes of the garden of
Sais."</p>

<p>She had spoken in Greek till then. Now she turned to the servants, who
were waiting at a respectful distance, and said in broken
Persian:&mdash;"You too must accept my thanks. You shall receive a thousand
gold staters. Boges," she added, turning to the eunuch, "I command you
to see that the sum is distributed not later than the day after
to-morrow! Lead me to my carriage, Croesus!"</p>

<p>The old man hastened to comply with her request. While he conducted
Nitetis to the carriage, she pressed his arm against her breast and
whispered, "Are you satisfied with me, my father?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, maiden," returned the old man, "you will be the
first at this court after the king's mother, for true regal pride
is on your brow, and you possess the art of doing great things
with small means. Believe me, a trifling gift, chosen as you can
choose, will cause greater pleasure to a nobleman than a heap
of gold flung down before him. The Persians are accustomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5097" id="Page_5097">[Pg 5097]</a></span>
to bestow and to receive costly gifts. They know how to enrich
one another. You will teach them to make each other happy.
How beautiful you are! Is that right, or do you desire higher
cushions? But what is that! Do you not see clouds of dust
rolling hither from the town? That must be Cambyses, who is
coming to meet you. Keep yourself upright, girl. Above all,
try to bear your husband's glance and return it. Few can bear
the fire of his eye. If you succeed in meeting it without fear
or embarrassment, you have conquered. Courage, courage, my
daughter! May Aphrodite adorn you with her loveliest charms!
To horse, my friends! I think the King is coming to meet us."</p>

<p>Nitetis sat very erect in the golden carriage, and pressed her hands
on her heart. The cloud of dust came nearer and nearer. Now bright
sunbeams were reflected in the weapons of the approaching host, and
darted from the cloud of dust like lightning from a stormy sky. Now
the cloud divided, and figures could be distinguished; now the
approaching procession vanished behind the thick bushes at a turn of
the road; and now, not a hundred feet away, the galloping riders were
seen distinctly as they approached nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>The whole procession seemed to consist of a gay crowd of
horses, men, purple, gold, silver, and jewels. More than two
hundred riders, all on snow-white Nis&aelig;an steeds, whose bridles
and caparisons glittered with gold bells and buckles, feathers,
tassels, and embroidery, were followed by a man who was often
carried away by the powerful coal-black horse on which he rode,
but who generally proved to the unmanageable, foaming animal
that he was strong enough to tame its wildness. The rider,
whose knees pressed the horse so that the animal trembled and
panted, wore a garment with a scarlet and white pattern, which
was embroidered with silver eagles and falcons. His trousers
were of purple, his boots of yellow leather. He wore a golden
belt round his waist, in which was a short dagger-like sword,
whose hilt and sheath were incrusted with jewels. The rest of
his dress resembled Bartja's. His tiara also was surrounded by
the blue-and-white fillet of the Ach&aelig;menid&aelig;. Thick jet-black
hair streamed from it. A thick beard of the same color covered
the whole lower portion of his hale, rigid face. His eyes were
even darker than his hair and beard, and glittered with a fire
that burned instead of warming. A deep red scar, caused by the
sword of a Massagetian warrior, marked the lofty brow, large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5098" id="Page_5098">[Pg 5098]</a></span>
aquiline nose, and thin lips of the rider.  His whole bearing
bore the stamp of great power and immoderate pride.</p>

<p>Nitetis could not turn her eyes from his form. She had never seen any
one like him. She thought she saw the essence of all manliness in the
intensely proud face. It seemed to her as if the whole world, but
especially she herself, had been created to serve this man. She feared
him, and yet her humble woman's heart longed to cling to this strong
man as the vine clings to the elm. She did not know whether the father
of all evil, terrible Seth, or the giver of all light, great Ra, was
to be imagined in this form.</p>

<p>As light and shade alternate when the heavens are clouded at noon, so
did deep red and ashy pallor appear on her face. She forgot the
precepts of her fatherly friend; and yet when Cambyses forced his wild
snorting steed to stand still by the side of her carriage, she gazed
breathlessly into the flashing eyes of the man, for she knew that he
was the King, though no one had told her.</p>

<p>The stern face of the ruler of half the world softened more and more,
the longer she, urged by a strange impulse, endured his piercing
glance. At last he waved his hand in welcome and rode towards her
companions, who had dismounted, and who either prostrated themselves
in the dust before the King, or stood bowing low, in accordance with
Persian custom, hiding their hands in the sleeves of their garments.</p>

<p>Now he himself sprang from his horse. At the same time all his
followers swung themselves out of the saddle. The carpet-bearers in
his train spread, quick as thought, a heavy purple carpet on the road,
so that the King's foot should not touch the dust. A few seconds
later, Cambyses greeted his friends and relations with a kiss.</p>

<p>Then he shook Croesus's hand, and ordered him to mount
again and accompany him to Nitetis as interpreter.</p>

<p>The highest dignitaries hastened up and helped the King to
mount. He gave the signal, and the whole procession moved on.
Croesus rode beside Cambyses by the golden carriage.</p>

<p>"She is beautiful, and pleasing to my heart," cried the Persian
to his Lydian friend. "Now translate to me faithfully what
she says in answer to my questions, for I understand only Persian,
Babylonian, and Median."</p>

<span class="caption"><i>BABYLONIAN MARRIAGE MARKET.</i></span>
<p class="center">Photogravure from a Painting by Edwin Long, R.A.</p>
<p>"Once a year in each village the maidens of age to marry were
collected all together into one place, while the men stood round them
in a circle. Then a herald called up the damsels one by one and
offered them for sale. He began with the most beautiful; when she was
sold for no small sum, he offered for sale the one who came next to
her in beauty. All of them were sold to be wives. The richest of the
Babylonians who wished to wed, bid against each other for the
loveliest maidens, while the humbler wife-seekers who were indifferent
about beauty took the more homely damsels with a marriage portion....
The marriage portions were furnished by the money paid for the
beautiful damsels, and thus the fairer maidens portioned out the
uglier.</p>

<p>No one was allowed to give his daughter in marriage to the man of his
choice, nor might any one carry away the damsel whom he had purchased
without finding bail really and truly to make her his wife. If,
however, it turned out that they did not agree, the money might be
paid back."&mdash;<i>Herodotus</i>, Book I. Sec. 196.</p>
<img src="images/market.png" width="640" height="418" alt="BABYLONIAN MARRIAGE MARKET." title="BABYLONIAN MARRIAGE MARKET." />
</div>

<p>Nitetis had understood his words. Inexpressible joy filled
her heart, and before Croesus could answer the King she said in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5099" id="Page_5099">[Pg 5099]</a></span>
a low tone, in broken Persian, "How shall I thank the gods,
who let me find favor in your eyes? I am not ignorant of the
language of my lord, for this noble old man has instructed me
in the Persian language during our long journey. Pardon me if
I can answer in broken words only. My time for instruction
was short, and my understanding is only that of a poor ignorant
maiden."</p>

<p>The usually stern King smiled. His vanity was flattered by
Nitetis's eagerness to gain his approbation, and this diligence in
a woman seemed as strange as it was praiseworthy to the Persian,
who was used to see women grow up in ignorance and idleness,
thinking of nothing but dress and intrigue.</p>

<p>He therefore answered with evident satisfaction, "I am glad
that I can speak to you without an interpreter. Continue to try
to learn the beautiful language of my fathers. My companion
Croesus shall remain your teacher in the future."</p>

<p>"Your command fills me with joy," said the old man, "for I
could not desire a more grateful or more eager pupil than the
daughter of Amasis."</p>

<p>"She confirms the ancient fame of Egyptian wisdom," returned
the King; "and I think that she will soon understand and
accept with all her soul the teachings of the magi, who will
instruct her in our religion."</p>

<p>Nitetis looked down. The dreaded moment was approaching.
She was henceforth to serve strange gods in place of the Egyptian
deities.</p>

<p>Cambyses did not observe her emotion, and continued:&mdash;"My
mother Cassandane shall initiate you in your duties as my wife.
I will conduct you to her myself to-morrow. I repeat what you
accidentally overheard: you please me. Look to it that you
keep my favor. We will try to make you like our country; and
because I am your friend I advise you to treat Boges, whom I
sent to meet you, graciously, for you will have to obey him in
many things, as he is the superintendent of the harem."</p>

<p>"He may be the head of the women's house," returned Nitetis. "But it
seems to me that no mortal but you has a right to command your wife.
Give but a sign and I will obey, but consider that I am a princess,
and come from a land where weak woman shares the rights of strong men;
that the same pride fills my breast which shines in your eyes, my beloved!
I will gladly obey you the great man, my husband and ruler; but it is as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5100" id="Page_5100">[Pg 5100]</a></span>
impossible for me to sue for the favor of the unmanliest
of men, a bought servant, as it is for me to obey his commands."</p>

<p>Cambyses's astonishment and satisfaction increased. He had
never heard any woman save his mother speak like this, and the
subtle way in which Nitetis unconsciously recognized and exalted
his power over her whole existence satisfied his self-complacency.
The proud man liked her pride. He nodded approvingly and
said, "You are right. I will have a special house prepared for
you. I alone will command you. The pleasant house in the hanging
gardens shall be prepared for you to-day."</p>

<p>"I thank you a thousand times!" cried Nitetis. "If you but
knew how you delight me by your gift! Your brother Bartja
told me much of the hanging gardens, and none of the splendors
of your great realm pleased us as much as the love of the king
who built the green mountain."</p>

<p>"To-morrow you will be able to enter your new dwelling.
Tell me how you and the Egyptians liked my envoys?"</p>

<p>"How can you ask! Who could become acquainted with noble Croesus
without loving him? Who could help admiring the excellent qualities of
the young heroes, your friends? They have become dear to our house,
especially your beautiful brother Bartja, who won all hearts. The
Egyptians are averse to strangers, but whenever Bartja appeared among
them a murmur of admiration arose from the gaping throng."</p>

<p>At these words the King's face grew dark. He gave his horse a heavy
blow, so that it reared, turned its head, galloped in front of his
retinue, and in a few minutes reached the walls of Babylon....</p>

<p>The walls seemed perfectly impregnable, for they were two
hundred cubits high, and their breadth was so great that two
carriages could easily pass each other. Two hundred and fifty
high towers surmounted and fortified this huge rampart. A
greater number of these citadels would have been necessary if
Babylon had not been protected on one side by impenetrable
marshes. The enormous city lay on both sides of the Euphrates.
It was more than nine miles in circumference, and the walls
protected buildings which surpassed even the pyramids and the
temples of Thebes and Memphis in size....</p>

<p>Nitetis looked with astonishment at this huge gate; with joyful
emotion she gazed at the long wide street, which was festively
decked in her honor.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he period of political disorder and disturbance which followed the
revolution of 1868 in Spain was also a period of disorder and decline
for the Spanish stage. The drama&mdash;throwing off the fetters of French
classicism that paralyzed inspiration at the beginning of the
century&mdash;had revived for a time. But after its rejuvenescence of the
glories of the Golden Age of Spanish literature, uniting a new beauty
of form with truth to nature in the Classic-Romantic School, it sank
into a debasement hitherto unknown. Meretricious sentiment, dullness,
or buffoonery, chiefly of foreign production, occupied the scene
before adorned by the imagination, the wisdom, and the wit, of a
Zorilla, a Tamayo, a Ventura de la Vega.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Jos&eacute; Echegaray</span></span>
</div>

<p>It was at this period of dramatic decadence
that Echegaray appeared to revive
once more the romantic traditions of the
Spanish stage, peopling it again with noble
and heroic figures,&mdash;in whom, however, the
chivalric spirit of the Middle Ages is at
times strangely joined to the casuistic modern
conscience. The explanation of this is
perhaps to be found in part in the mental
constitution of the dramatist, in whom the
analytic and the imaginative faculties are united in marked degree,
and who had acquired a distinguished reputation as a civil engineer
long before he entered the lists as an aspirant for dramatic honors.
Born in Madrid in 1832, his earlier years were passed in Murcia, where
he took his degree of bachelor of arts, applying himself afterward
with notable success to the study of the exact sciences. Returning
to Madrid, after enlarging his knowledge of his profession of civil
engineer by practical study in various provinces of Spain, he was
appointed a professor in the School of Engineers, where he taught
theoretical and applied mathematics, finding time however for the
production of important scientific works, and for the study of political
economy and general literature. On the breaking out of the
revolution of 1868 he joined actively in the movement, taking office
under the new government as Director of Public Works, and holding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5102" id="Page_5102">[Pg 5102]</a></span>a ministerial portfolio. He took office a second time in 1872, and
later filled the post of Minister of Finance, which he resigned on the
proclamation of the Republic. Retiring from public life, he went to
Paris; and while there wrote, being then a little past forty, his first
dramatic work, 'The Check-Book,' a domestic drama in one act,
which was represented anonymously in Madrid two years later, when
the author for the third time held a ministerial portfolio.</p>

<p>'The Check-Book' was followed in rapid succession by a series of
productions whose titles, 'La Esposa del Vengador' (The Avenger's
Bride), 'La Ultima Noche' (The Last Night), 'En el Pu&ntilde;o de la
Espada' (In the Hilt of the Sword), 'Como Empieza y Como Acaba'
(How it Begins and How it Ends), sufficiently indicate their character.
They are of unequal merit, but all show dramatic power of
a high order. But on the representation in 1877 of 'Locura o
Santidad?' (Madman or Saint?), the fame of the statesman and the
scientist was completely and finally eclipsed by that of the dramatist,
in whom the press and public of Madrid unanimously recognized
a new and vital force in the Spanish drama. In this tragedy the
keynote of Echegaray's philosophy is clearly struck. Moral perfection,
unfaltering obedience to the right, is the end and aim of man;
and the catastrophe is brought about by the inability of the hero to
make those nearest to him accept this ideal of life. "Then virtue is
but a lie," he cries, when the conviction of his moral isolation is
forced upon him; "and you, all of you whom I have most loved in
this world, perceiving what I regarded as divinity in you, are only
miserable egoists, incapable of sacrifice, a prey to greed and the
mere playthings of passion! Then you are all of you but clay; you
resolve yourselves to dust and let the wind of the tempest carry you
off! ... Beings shaped without conscience or free-will are simply
atoms that meet to-day and separate to-morrow. Such is matter&mdash;then
let it go!"</p>

<p>But the punishment of sin, in Echegaray's moral code, is visited
upon the innocent equally with the guilty; and the guilty are never
allowed to escape the retributive consequences of their wrong-doing.
The pessimistic coloring of the picture would be at times unendurably
oppressive, were it not relieved and lightened by the moral
dignity of the hero. Echegaray's pessimism is, so to say, altruistic,
never egoistic; and the compensating sense of righteousness vindicated
rarely fails to explain, if not to justify, his darkest scenes.</p>

<p>Judged by the canons of art, Echegaray's dramatic productions
will be found to have many imperfections. But their defects are the
defects of genius, not of mediocrity, and spring generally from an
excess of imagination, not from poverty of invention or faulty insight.
The plot is often overweighted with an accumulation of incidents,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5103" id="Page_5103">[Pg 5103]</a></span>and the means employed to bring about the desired end are often
lacking in verisimilitude. Synthetic rather than analytic in his
methods, and a master in producing contrasts, Echegaray captivates
the imagination by arts which the cooler judgment not seldom condemns.
His characters too are not always inhabitants of the real
world, and not infrequently act contrary to the laws which govern it.
The secondary characters are too often carelessly drawn, sometimes
being mere shadowy outlines, while an altogether disproportionate
part of the development of the plot is intrusted to them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the world of the passions Echegaray treads
with secure step. Its labyrinthine windings, its depths and its heights,
are all familiar to him. Here every accent uttered is the accent of
truth; every act is prompted by unerring instinct. Nothing is false;
nothing is trivial; nothing is strained. The elemental forces of nature
seem to be at work, and the catastrophe results as inevitably from
their action as if decreed by fate.</p>

<p>The genius of Echegaray, which in its irregular grandeur and its
ethical tendency has been not inaptly likened by a Spanish critic to
that of Victor Hugo, rarely descends from the tragic heights on
which it achieved its first and its greatest triumphs; but that its
range has been limited by choice, not nature, is abundantly proved in
the best of his lighter productions, 'Un Critico Incipiente' (An Embryo
Critic). Of his achievement in tragedy the culminating point was
reached&mdash;after a second series of noteworthy productions, among
them 'Lo Que no Puede Decirse' (What Cannot be Told), 'Mar Sin
Orillas' (A Shoreless Sea), and 'En el Seno de la Muerte' (In the
Bosom of Death)&mdash;in 'El Gran Galeoto' (The Great Galeoto), represented
in 1881 before an audience which hailed its author as a
"prodigy of genius," a second Shakespeare. Other notable works
followed,&mdash;'Conflicto entre Dos Deberes' (Conflict between Two
Duties), 'Vida Alegre y Muerte Triste' (A Merry Life and a Sad
Death), 'Lo Sublime en lo Vulgar' (The Sublime in the Commonplace);
but 'El Gran Galeoto' has remained thus far its author's
supreme dramatic achievement. In its title is personified the evil
speaking which not always with evil intent, sometimes even with
the best motives, slays, with a venom surer than that of the adder's
tongue, the reputation which it attacks; turning innocence itself by
its contaminating power into guilt.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Don Lorenzo, a man of wealth and position living in Madrid, has
discovered that he is the son, not as he and all the world had
supposed, of the lady whose wealth and name he has inherited, but of
his nurse Juana, who dies after she has revealed to him the secret of
his birth. In consequence he resolves publicly to renounce his name
and his possessions, although by doing so he will prevent the marriage
of his daughter Inez to Edward, the son of the Duchess of Almonte. The
mother will consent to Don Lorenzo's renunciation of his possessions
but not of his name, as this would throw a stigma on Inez's origin. He
refuses to listen either to the reasoning or to the entreaties of his
wife, the duchess, Edward, and Dr. Tom&aacute;s. Finally they are persuaded
that he is mad, and Dr. Tom&aacute;s calls in a specialist to examine him.
The specialist, with two keepers, arrives at the house at the same
time with the notary, whom Don Lorenzo has sent for to make before him
a formal act of renunciation of his name and possessions.]</p></div>

<p class="center">Don Lorenzo <i>enters and stands listening to</i> Inez</p>

<p><i>Don Lorenzo</i> [<i>aside</i>]&mdash;"Die," she said!</p>

<p><i>Edward</i>&mdash;You to die!  No, Inez, not that; do not say
that.</p>

<p><i>Inez</i>&mdash;And why not? If I do not die of grief&mdash;if happiness
could ever visit me again&mdash;I should die of remorse.</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i> [<i>aside</i>]&mdash;"Of remorse!" She! "If happiness could
ever visit her again!" What new fatality floats in the air and
hangs threateningly above my head? Remorse! I have surprised
another word in passing! I traverse rooms and halls, and I go
from one place to another, urged by intolerable anguish, and I
hear words that I do not understand, and I meet glances that I
do not understand, and tears greet me here and smiles there, and
no one opposes me, and every one avoids me or watches me.
[<i>Aloud.</i>] What is this? What is this?</p>

<p><i>Inez</i> [<i>hurrying to him and throwing herself into his arms</i>]&mdash;Father!</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i>&mdash;Inez! How pale you are! Why are your lips drawn

lovely in her sorrow! And I am to blame for all!</p>

<p><i>Inez</i>&mdash;No, father.</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i>&mdash;No one; you are right.</p>

<p><i>Edward</i> [<i>with energy</i>]&mdash;If I am right, then you are wrong.</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i>&mdash;I am right also. There is something more pallid
than the pallid brow of a lovesick maiden; there is something
sadder than the sad tears that fall from her beautiful eyes; something
more bitter than the smile that contracts her lips; something
more tragic than the death of her beloved.</p>

<p><i>Edward</i> [<i>with scornful vehemence</i>]&mdash;And what is that pallor,
what are those tears, and what the tragedies you speak of?</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i>&mdash;Insensate! [<i>Seizing him by the arm.</i>] The pallor
of crime, the tears of remorse, the consciousness of our own vileness.</p>

<p><i>Edward</i>&mdash;And it would be vile, and criminal, and a source of
remorse, to make Inez happy?</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i> [<i>despairingly</i>]&mdash;It ought not to be so&mdash;but it would!
[<i>Pause.</i>] And this it is that tortures me. This is the thought
that is driving me mad!</p>

<p><i>Inez</i>&mdash;No, father, do not say that! Follow the path you have
marked out for yourself, without thought of me. What does it
matter whether I live or die?</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i>&mdash;Inez!</p>

<p><i>Inez</i>&mdash;But do not vacillate&mdash;and above all, let no one see
that you vacillate; let your speech be clear and convincing as it
is now; let not anger blind you. Be calm, be calm, father; I
implore it of you in the name of God.</p>

<p><i>Lorenzo</i>&mdash;What do you mean by those words? I do not understand
you.</p>

<p><i>Inez</i>&mdash;Do I rightly know myself what I mean? There&mdash;I
am going. I do not wish to pain you.</p>

heart; if you would but silence the cavilings of your conscience.</p>

not anger him, or you will make him hate you.</p>

my daughter!</p>

Enough! I must be calm. Treachery has begun its work; then let the
punishment begin too. [<i>Aloud.</i>] The hour has come for me to perform a
sacred duty, though a most painful one. It would be useless to ask you
to witness formalities which the law requires, but which you would
only find irksome. The representative of the law awaits me in yonder
room; and in obedience to another and a higher law, I am going now to
renounce a fortune which is not mine, and a name which neither I nor
my family can conscientiously bear longer. After this is done I will
return here, and with my wife, and&mdash;and my daughter&mdash;and let no one
seek to dissuade me from my purpose, for it would be in vain&mdash;I will
leave this house which has been for me in the past the abode of love
and happiness, but which is to-day the abode of treachery and
baseness. Gentlemen [<i>to Dr. Tom&aacute;s and Dr. Berm&uacute;dez</i>], lead the way; I
beg you to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_EDDAS" id="THE_EDDAS"></a>THE EDDAS</h2>

<h4>(ICELANDIC; NINTH TO THIRTEENTH CENTURIES)</h4>

<h4>BY WILLIAM H. CARPENTER</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he fanciful but still commonly believed meaning of the word "Edda,"
which even many of the dictionaries explain as "great-grandmother,"
does not, after all, inaptly describe by suggestion the general
character of the work to which it is given. The picture of an ancient
dame at the fireside, telling tales and legendary lore of times whose
memory has all but disappeared, is a by no means inappropriate
personification, even if it has no other foundation. In point of fact,
'Edda' as the title of a literary work has nothing whatsoever to do
with a great-grandmother, but means "the art of poetry," "poetics";
and only by an extension of its original use does it belong to all
that is now included under it.</p>

<p>There are in reality two 'Eddas,' which are in a certain sense
connected in subject-material, but yet in more ways than one are
wholly distinct. As originally applied, the name now used collectively
unquestionably belonged to the one, variously called, to distinguish
it from the other, the 'Younger Edda,' on account of the relative age
of its origin; the 'Prose Edda,' since in its greater part it is
written in prose; and the 'Snorra Edda,' the Edda of Snorri, from the
author of the work in its original form. In contradistinction to this,
the other is called the 'Elder Edda,' the 'Poetical Edda,' and from
the name of its once assumed author, the 'S&aelig;mundar Edda,' the Edda of
S&aelig;mund.</p>

<p>Legitimately and by priority of usage, the name 'Edda' belongs to the
first-named work alone. In the form in which it has ultimately come
down to us, this is the compilation of many hands at widely different
times; but in its most important and fundamental parts it was
undoubtedly either written by the Icelander Snorri himself, or under
his immediate supervision.</p>

<p>Snorri Sturluson, its author, both from the part he played in national
politics in his day and from his literary legacy to the present, is
altogether the most remarkable man in the history of Iceland. He was
born in 1179, his father, Sturla Thordarson, being one of the most
powerful chieftains of the island. As was the custom of the time, he
was sent from home to be fostered, remaining away until his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5114" id="Page_5114">[Pg 5114]</a></span>
foster-father's death, or until he was nineteen years old; his own
father in the meantime having died as well. He entered upon active
life with but little more than his own ambition to further him; but
through his brother's influence he made the following year a brilliant
marriage, and thus laid the foundation of his power, which thereafter
steadily grew. In 1215 Snorri was elected "Speaker of the Law" for the
Commonwealth. At the expiration of his term of service in the summer
of 1218 he went to Norway, where he was received with extraordinary
hospitality both by King Hakon, who made him his liegeman, and by the
King's father-in-law, Earl Skuli. On the authority of some of the
sagas, he is said to have promised the latter at this time to use his
influence to bring Iceland under the dominion of Norway. Two years
later he returned to Iceland, taking back with him as a present from
the King a ship and many other valuable gifts. In 1222 he was again
made "Speaker of the Law," which post he now held continuously for
nine years.</p>

<p>Iceland, as the Commonwealth neared its end, was torn apart by the
jealous feuds of the chieftains. A long series of complications had
aroused a bitter hostility to Snorri among his own relatives. In 1229,
he found it necessary to ride to the Althing at the head of eight
hundred men. The matter did not then come to an open rupture, but in
1239 it finally resulted in a regular battle, in which Snorri's
faction was worsted. To avoid consequences he immediately after fled
to Norway. Unwisely, he here gave his adherence to Earl Skuli, now at
odds with the King, and thereby incurred the active displeasure of the
latter; who, evidently fearing the use of Snorri's power against him,
forbade him by letter to return to Iceland. The command was
disregarded, however, and he presently was back again in his native
land. In 1240 Skuli was slain, and shortly afterward King Hakon seems
to have resolved upon Snorri's death. Using Arni, a son-in-law of the
Icelander, as a willing messenger, he sent a letter to Gissur, another
son-in-law, between whom and his father-in-law an active feud was on
foot, demanding that he send the latter a prisoner to Norway, or if
that were impossible, to kill him. Gissur accordingly, with seventy
men at his back, came to Snorri's farmstead Reykjaholt on the night of
the 22d of September, 1241, when the old chieftain was mercilessly
slain in the cellar, where he had taken refuge, by an unknown member
of the band.</p>

<p>In spite of his political life, Snorri found opportunity for abundant
literary work. The 'Icelandic Annals' say that he "compiled the 'Edda'
and many other books of historical learning, and Icelandic sagas." Of
these, however, only two have come down to us: his 'Edda' and the
sagas of the Norse kings, known since the seventeenth century as the
'Heimskringla,' the best piece of independent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5115" id="Page_5115">[Pg 5115]</a></span>prose literature, and
in its bearing the most important series of sagas, of all the number
that are left to attest the phenomenal literary activity of the
Icelanders.</p>

<p>Snorri's 'Edda'&mdash;both as he, the foremost poet of his day, originally
conceived it, and with its subsequent additions&mdash;is a handbook for
poets, an <i>Ars poetica</i>, as its name itself signifies. That it served
its purpose as a recognized authority is discoverable from the
references to it in later Icelandic poets, where "rules of Edda,"
"laws of Edda," "Eddic art," and "Edda" are of frequent occurrence, as
indicating an ideal of poetical expression striven for by some and
deprecated by others. As Snorri wrote it, the 'Edda' was an admirably
arranged work in three parts: the 'Gylfaginning,' a compendium of the
old mythology, the knowledge of which in Snorri's day was fast dying
out; the 'Sk&aacute;ldskaparm&aacute;l,' a dictionary of poetical expressions, many
of which, contained in ancient poems, were no longer intelligible; and
the 'H&aacute;ttatal,' a poem or rather series of poems, exemplifying in its
own construction the use and kinds of metre. As it has come down to
us, it has been greatly added to and altered. A long preface filled
with the learning of the Middle Ages now introduces the whole; the
introductions and conclusions of the parts of the work have been
extended; several old poems have been included; a Sk&aacute;ldatal, or list
of skalds, has been added, as have also several grammatical and
rhetorical tracts,&mdash;some of which are of real historical value.</p>

<p>With regard to matter and manner, the parts of Snorri's 'Edda' are as
follows:&mdash;The 'Gylfaginning' (the Delusion of Gylfi) is a series of
tales told in answer to the questions of Gylfi, a legendary Swedish
king, who comes in disguise to the gods in Asgard to learn the secret
of their power. By way of illustration it quotes, among other poetical
citations, verses from several of the lays of the 'Elder Edda.' The
'Sk&aacute;ldskaparm&aacute;l' (Poetical Diction) is also in great part in the form
of questions and answers. It contains under separate heads the
periphrases, appellatives, and synonyms used in ancient verse, which
are often explained by long tales; and like the preceding part, it
also is illustrated by numerous poetical quotations here, particularly
from the skalds. The 'H&aacute;ttatal' (Metres), finally, consists of three
poems: the first an encomium on the Norwegian king Hakon, and the
others on Earl Skuli. It exemplifies in not fewer than one hundred and
two strophes the use of as many kinds of metre, many of them being
accompanied by a prose commentary of greater or less length.</p>

<p>That Snorri really wrote the work as here described seems to be
undoubted, although there is no trace of it as a whole until after his
death. At what period of his career it arose, can however merely be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5116" id="Page_5116">[Pg 5116]</a></span>
conjectured. We only know with certainty the date of the 'H&aacute;ttatal';
that may not unlikely have been the nucleus of the whole, which falls
undoubtedly between 1221 and 1223, shortly after the return from the
first visit to Norway. The oldest manuscript of the 'Snorra
Edda,'&mdash;now in the University Library at Upsala, Sweden,&mdash;which was
written before 1300, assigns the work to him by name; and the
'Icelandic Annals,' as has already been stated, under the year of his
death corroborate the statement of his authorship of "the Edda"&mdash;that
is, of course, of this particular 'Edda,' for there can be no thought
of the other.</p>

<p>Snorri's poetical work outside of the 'Edda' is represented only by
fugitive verses. An encomium that he wrote on the wife of Earl Hakon
has been lost. As a poet, Snorri undoubtedly stands upon a lower plane
than that which he occupies as a historian. He wrote at a time when
poetry was in its decline in Iceland; and neither in the 'H&aacute;ttatal'
nor in his other verse, except in form and phraseology, of which he
had a wonderful control, does he rise to the level of a host of
earlier skalds. It is his critical knowledge of the old poetry of
Norway and Iceland that makes his 'Edda' of such unique value, and
particularly as no small part of the material accessible to him has
since been irrevocably lost. Snorri's 'Edda,' in its very conception,
is a wonderful book to have arisen at the time in which it was
written, and in no other part of the Germanic North in the thirteenth
century had such a thing been possible. It is not only, however, as a
commentary on old Norse poetry that it is remarkable. Its importance
as a compendium of the ancient Northern mythology is as great,&mdash;one
whose loss nothing could supplant. As a whole, it is of incalculable
value to the entire Germanic race for the light that it sheds upon its
early intellectual life, its ethics, and its religion.</p>

<p>The history of the 'Elder Edda' does not go back of the middle of the
seventeenth century. In 1643 the Icelandic bishop Brynjolf Sveinsson
sent as a present to Frederick III. of Denmark several old Icelandic
vellums, among which was the manuscript, dating, according to the most
general assignment, from not earlier than 1350; since called the
'Codex Regius' of the 'Edda.' Not a word is known about its previous
history. As to when it came into the hands of the bishop, or where it
was discovered, he has given us no clew whatsoever. He had
nevertheless not only a name ready for it, but a distinct theory of
its authorship, for he wrote on the back of a copy that he had made,
"Edda S&aelig;mundi Multiscii" (the Edda of S&aelig;mund the Wise).</p>

<p>Both Bishop Brynjolf's title for the work and his assumption as to the
name of its author&mdash;for both are apparently his&mdash;are open to
criticism. The name 'Edda' belongs, as we have seen, to Snorri's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5117" id="Page_5117">[Pg 5117]</a></span>
book; to which it was given, if not by himself, certainly by one of
his immediate followers. It is not difficult, however, to explain its
new application. Snorri's 'Edda' cites, as has been mentioned, a
number of single strophes of ancient poems, many of which were now
found to be contained in Brynjolf's collection in a more or less
complete form. This latter was, accordingly, not unnaturally looked
upon as the source of the material of Snorri's work; and since its
subject-matter too was the old poetry, it was consequently an earlier
'Edda.' Subsequently the title was extended to include a number of
poems in the same manner found elsewhere; and 'Edda' has since been
irretrievably the title both of the old Norse lays and of the old
Norse <i>Ars poetica</i>, to which it more appropriately belongs.</p>

<p>The attribution of the work to S&aelig;mund was even less justifiable.
S&aelig;mund Sigfusson was an Icelandic priest, who lived from 1056 to 1133.
As a young man he studied in Germany, France, and Italy, but came back
to Iceland about 1076. Afterward he settled down as priest and
chieftain, as was his father before him, on the paternal estate Oddi
in the south of Iceland, where he lived until his death. Among his
contemporaries and subsequently he was celebrated for his great
learning, the memory of which has even come down to the present day in
popular legend, where like learned men elsewhere he is made an adept
in the black art, and many widely spread tales of supernatural power
have clustered locally about his name. S&aelig;mund is the first writer
among the Icelanders of whom we have any information; and besides
poems, he is reputed to have written some of the best of the sagas and
other historical works. It is not unlikely that he did write parts of
the history of Iceland and Norway in Latin, but nothing has come down
to us that is with certainty to be attributed to him. There is however
no ancient reference whatsoever to S&aelig;mund as a poet, and it is but a
legend that connects him in any way with the Eddie lays. Internal
criticism readily yields the fact that they are not only of widely
different date of origin, but are so unlike in manner and in matter
that it is idle to suppose a single authorship at all. Nor is it
possible that S&aelig;mund, as Bishop Brynjolf may have supposed was the
case, even collected the lays contained in this 'Edda.' It is on the
contrary to be assumed that the collection, of which Brynjolf's
manuscript is but a copy, arose during the latter half of the twelfth
century, in the golden age of Icelandic literature; a time when
attention was most actively directed to the past, when many of the
sagas current hitherto only as oral tradition were given a permanent
form, and historical works of all sorts were written and compiled.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, that here is a collection of old Norse
poems, the memory of whose real time and place of origin has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5118" id="Page_5118">[Pg 5118]</a></span>
disappeared, and whose authorship is unknown. Earlier commentators
supposed them to be of extreme age, and carried them back to the very
childhood of the race. Modern criticism has dispelled the illusions of
any such antiquity. It has been proved, furthermore, that the oldest
of the poems does not go back of the year 850, and that the youngest
may have been written as late as 1200. As to their place of origin,
although all have come to us from Iceland, by far the greater number
of them apparently originated in Norway; several arose in the Norse
colonies in Greenland; and although the whole collection was made in
Iceland, where alone many of them had been remembered, but two are
undoubtedly of distinct Icelandic parentage. With regard to their
authorship, results are less direct. Folk-songs they are not in the
proper sense of the word, in that in their present shape they are the
work of individual poets, who made over in versified form material
already existing in oral tradition. Only a small part of the ancient
poetry that arose in this way has been preserved. From prose
interpolations which supply breaks in the continuity of the lays in
the 'Elder Edda' itself, as well as from isolated strophes of old
poems, else unknown, quoted in Snorri's 'Edda,' and from the citation
and use of such poetical material in sagas and histories,&mdash;we know for
a certainty that many other lays in the ancient manner once existed
that have now been for all time lost.</p>

<p>Brynjolf's manuscript contains, whole or in part, as they are now
considered to exist, thirty-two poems. From other sources six poems
have since been added, presumably as ancient as the lays of the 'Codex
Regius,' so that the 'Elder Edda' is made up of thirty-eight poems,
not all of which, however, are even reasonably complete. In form they
are in alliterative verse, but three different metres being
represented, all the simplest and least artificial of the many kinds
used by the Norsemen. In content the lays fall under three heads: they
are mythic, in that they contain the myths of the old heathen religion
of the Norsemen; ethic, in that they embody their views of life and
rules of living; or they are heroic, in that they recount the deeds of
legendary heroes of the race.</p>

<p>The mythic poems of the 'Edda,' taken together, give us a tolerably
complete picture of the Northern mythology in the Viking Age; although
some of them were not written until after the introduction of
Christianity, and are therefore open to the imputation of having been
to a greater or less extent affected by its teachings. The oldest
poems of the collection are mythical in character. In some of them a
particular god is the principal figure. Several of them, like the
'Vafthr&uacute;dnism&aacute;l,' the 'Grimnism&aacute;l,' 'Baldrs Draumar,' and the
'H&aacute;rbardslj&oacute;d,' in this way are particularly devoted to Odin, whose
supremacy they show over all other beings, and whose part they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5119" id="Page_5119">[Pg 5119]</a></span>
describe in the government of the universe; in others, like the
'Hymiskvida,' the 'Thrymskvida,' and the 'Alvism&aacute;l,' Thor occupies the
prominent part in his strife with the giants; single ones have other
gods as their principal actors, like Skirnir, the messenger of Frey,
in the 'Skirnism&aacute;l,' Loki, the god of destruction, in the 'Lokasenna,'
or Heimdall, the guardian of the rainbow bridge which stretched from
heaven to earth, in the 'R&iacute;gsth&uacute;la.' A few of them are both mythic and
heroic at the same time, like the 'Lay of V&ouml;lund,' which tells of the
fearful revenge of the mythical smith upon the Swedish king; or the
'Song of Grotti,' the magical mill, which ground what was wished,
first peace and gold for its owner, King Frodi of Denmark, but later
so much salt on the ship of Mysing, who had conquered the king and
taken it away, that all together sunk into the sea, which henceforth
was salt. By far the greater of the mythic lays is the long but
fragmentary poem 'V&ouml;lusp&aacute;,' the 'Prophecy of the Sibyl,' which is
entitled to stand not only at the head of the Eddic songs but of all
old Germanic poetry, for the beauty and dignity of its style, its
admirable choice of language, and the whole inherent worth of its
material. Its purpose is to give a complete picture, although only in
its most essential features, of the whole heathen religion. It
contains in this way the entire history of the universe: the creation
of the world out of chaos; the origin of the giants, the dwarfs, of
gods, and of men; and ends with their destruction and ultimate
renewal. The Sibyl is represented at the beginning in an assemblage of
the whole human race, whom she bids be silent in order that she may be
heard. Many of the strophes, even in translation, retain much of their
inherent dignity and poetic picturesqueness:&mdash;</p>

<p>The gods thereupon gave the heavenly bodies names, and ordained
the times and seasons. This was the golden age of the young world,
before guilt and sin had come into it; a time of joy and beneficent
activity. A deed of violence proclaimed its approaching end, and
out of the slain giants' blood and bones the dwarfs were created.
The gods then made the first man and woman, for whom the Norns
established laws and allotted life and destiny. The use of gold was
introduced, and with it its attendant evils; the Valkyries come, and
the first warfare occurs in the world; the gods' stronghold is broken,
and Odin hurls his spear among the people. In rapid succession
follow the pictures of the awful ills that happen to gods and men,
which finally end in Ragnar&ouml;k, the twilight of the gods, and the
conflagration of the universe. This however is not the end. The
Sibyl describes the reappearance of the green earth from the ocean.
The gods again come back, and a new golden age begins of peace
and happiness which shall endure forever.</p>

<p>Scarcely inferior to the 'V&ouml;lusp&aacute;' for the importance of its
material is the ethical poem or rather collection of poems called
the 'H&aacute;vam&aacute;l,' the 'Speech of the High One,'&mdash;that is, of Odin
the supreme god. The poem consists of sententious precepts and
epigrammatic sayings, which ultimately have been set together to
form a connected, though scarcely systematic, philosophy of life.
The whole is naturally attributed to Odin, the source of all wisdom,
the father and giver of all things. A part of the poem is the oldest
of all the Eddic lays, and the whole of it was at hand early in the
tenth century. Although many of its maxims show a primitive state
of society, as a whole they are the experience of a people more
advanced in culture than we are apt to fancy the Norsemen of the
Viking Age, who could nevertheless philosophize at home as sturdily
as they fought abroad. The morality of the 'H&aacute;vam&aacute;l' is not
always our morality, but many of its maxims are eternally true. Its
keynote, again and again repeated, is the perishability of all earthly
possessions, and the endurance alone of fairly won fame:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The heroic poems of the 'Elder Edda' recount as if belonging to a
single legendary cycle what originally belonged to two; the one of
Northern origin, the other the common property of the whole Germanic
race. They are the Helgi poems on the one hand, and the
V&ouml;lsung poems on the other. Together they tell the "Story of the
North," and come nearest to forming its greatest epic; it is the same
story which Wagner has set to music as immortal in his 'Ring
of the Nibelung,'&mdash;although the principal source of his material is
the prose 'V&ouml;lsunga Saga' and not the 'Edda,'&mdash;and which in a form
much later than the Icelandic versions is also told in the German
'Nibelungenlied.'</p>

<p>The Helgi poems are only loosely connected with the story of
Sigurd the V&ouml;lsung, and originally, but without doubt long before they
were committed to writing, had no connection with it at all. As
they now stand at the head of the heroic lays they are made to tell
the deeds of early members of the V&ouml;lsung race; namely, of Helgi
Hj&ouml;rvard's son, and Helgi Hundingsbane, who is said to have been
named after him. The latter the 'Edda' makes the son of Sigmund
the V&ouml;lsung, and consequently an elder brother of Sigurd, the hero
of the subsequent cycle of poems. To these last they are joined by
a prose piece ending with a description of Sigurd's parentage and
birth, and his own personality, which the poems themselves do not
give at length.</p>

<p>The remaining poems, fifteen in all, tell the old Germanic story of
Sigurd, the Siegfried of the Nibelungenlied, in the most ancient form
in which it has come down to us. As contained in the 'Edda' it is a
picture of great deeds, painted in powerful strokes which gain in
force by the absence of carefully elaborated detail. In various ways
it is unfortunate that the lays composing the cycle are not more
closely consecutive; a difficulty that was felt by the earliest editors
of the manuscript, who endeavored to bring the poems and fragments
of poems then extant into some sort of connection, by the interpolation
of prose passages of various lengths wherever it was considered
necessary to the intelligibility of the story. As it is however there
is even yet, and cannot help but be, on account of the differences in
age, authorship, and place of origin of the lays, an inherent lack of
correlation. Many of the poems overlap, and parts of the action are
told several times and in varying form.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5122" id="Page_5122">[Pg 5122]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sigurd poems belong to a time prior to the introduction of
Christianity, as is incontestably proved by the genuine heathen spirit
that throughout pervades them. Their action is in the early days,
when the gods walked upon earth and mixed themselves in human
affairs. The real theme of the epic which the lays form is the
mythical golden hoard, and with it the fated ring of the Nibelung,
owned originally by the dwarf Andvari, from whom it is wrung by
the gods in their extremity. Andvari curses it to its possessors, and
it is cursed again by the gods who are forced to deliver it up to
Hreidmar as blood-money for his son, whom Loki had slain. Fafnir
and Regin, the brothers of the slain Ottur, demand of their father
their share of the blood-fine, and when this is refused, Hreidmar is
killed while asleep, and Regin is driven away by Fafnir, who then
in the guise of a dragon lies upon the golden hoard to guard it.
Egged on by Regin, Sigurd slays Fafnir, and Regin also when he
learns that he intends treachery.</p>

<p>Sigurd gives the ring of Andvari, taken from the hoard, to the
Valkyrie Brynhild, as a pledge of betrothal; and when in the likeness
of Gunnar the Nibelung,&mdash;having by wiles forgotten his former
vows,&mdash;he rides to her through the fire, the ring is given back to
him by Brynhild, who does not recognize him. The fatal ring is now
given by Sigurd to his wife, Gudrun the Nibelung, who in a moment
of anger shows it to Brynhild and taunts her with a recital of his
history. Brynhild cannot bear to see the happiness of Gudrun, and
does not rest until Sigurd is slain; and in slaying him, Guthorm, the
youngest of the Nibelungs, is killed, struck down by the sword of
the dying Sigurd. Brynhild, who will not outlive Sigurd, perishes on
her own sword. Gudrun is subsequently, against her will, wedded to
Atli the Hun. Gunnar and H&ouml;gni, her brothers, the two remaining
Nibelungs, are invited to visit Atli, when they are straightway fallen
upon, their followers are killed, and they are bound. They are asked
to give up the golden hoard, whose hiding-place was known to them
alone; but Gunnar first demands the death of his brother H&ouml;gni, and
then triumphantly tells Atli that the treasure is forever hidden in the
Rhine,&mdash;where, he only knows. He is cast into a serpent pit, and
dies. Atli's sons and Gudrun's are slain by their mother, changed by
the madness of grief at the slaughter of her brothers into an avenging
Fury, and Atli himself and his men are burned in the hall.
Carried then by the sea, into which she has hurled herself, Gudrun
comes to the land of King Jonakr, who makes her his wife. Swanhild,
the daughter of Sigurd and Gudrun, had been married to King
J&ouml;rmunrek, but coming under unjust suspicion, is trodden to death
by horses; and Gudrun dies of a broken heart, with a prayer to
Sigurd upon her lips. Last of all, the sons of Gudrun and Jonakr,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5123" id="Page_5123">[Pg 5123]</a></span>who, incited by their mother, had been sent out to avenge their
sister, are stoned to death; and the curse only ceases to work when
there is nothing more left for it to wreak itself upon.</p>

<p>It is a story of great deeds, whose motives are the bitter passions of
that early time before the culture of Christianity had softened the
hearts of men. The psychological truthfulness of its characters,
however, in spite of their distance from to-day, is none the less
unmistakable; and we watch the action with bated breath, as they are
hurried on by a fate as relentless and inevitable as any that ever
pursued an Oedipus. They are not the indistinct and shadowy forms
which in many early literatures seem to grope out toward us from the
mists of the past, whose clinging heaviness the present is unable
wholly to dispel, but are human men and women who live and act; and
the principal characters, particularly, in this way become the
realities of history, instead of what they actually are, the creations
of legend and myth.</p>

<p>Many of the poems of the 'Edda' have been several times translated
into English. Notable renderings are those by Dean Herbert,
and by William Morris in the translation of the 'V&ouml;lsunga Saga,' by
Magnusson and Morris. The only metrical version of all the lays is
that of Benjamin Thorpe (London, 1866). A literal translation of the
entire extant old poetry of the North is contained in Vigfusson's
monumental work, the 'Corpus Poeticum Boreale.' The 'Snorra
Edda' has been translated by G.W. Dasent (Stockholm, 1842); by
I.A. Blackwell in 'Northern Antiquities' (London, 1847); and by R.
B. Anderson (Chicago, 1880).</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Thor's Adventures on his Journey to the Land of the Giants</span></h3>

<h4>From 'Northern Antiquities': Bohn's Library (London), 1878</h4>


<p>One day the god Thor set out, in his car drawn by two he-goats, and
accompanied by Loki, on a journey. Night coming on, they put up at a
peasant's cottage, when Thor killed his goats, and after flaying them
put them in the kettle. When the flesh was sodden, he sat down with,
his fellow-traveler to supper, and invited the peasant and his family
to partake of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5124" id="Page_5124">[Pg 5124]</a></span> the repast. The peasant's son was named Thjalfi, and
his daughter R&ouml;ska. Thor bade them throw all the bones into the goats'
skins, which were spread out near the fireplace; but young Thjalfi
broke one of the shank-bones with his knife, to come at the marrow.
Thor having passed the night in the cottage, rose at the dawn of day;
and when he was dressed took his mallet Mj&ouml;lnir, and lifting it up,
consecrated the goats' skins, which he had no sooner done than the two
goats reassumed their wonted form, only that one of them now limped in
one of its hind legs. Thor, perceiving this, said that the peasant or
one of his family had handled the shank-bone of this goat too roughly,
for he saw clearly that it was broken. It may readily be imagined how
frightened the peasant was, when he saw Thor knit his brows, and grasp
the handle of his mallet with such force that the joints of his
fingers became white from the exertion. Fearing to be struck down by
the very looks of the god, the peasant and his family made joint suit
for pardon, offering whatever they possessed as an atonement for the
offense committed. Thor, seeing their fear, desisted from his wrath
and became more placable, and finally contented himself by requiring
the peasant's children, Thjalfi and R&ouml;ska, who became his
bond-servants, and have followed him ever since.</p>

<p>Leaving his goats with the peasant, Thor proceeded eastward on the
road to J&ouml;tunheim, until he came to the shores of a vast and deep sea,
which having passed over, he penetrated into a strange country along
with his companions, Loki, Thjalfi, and R&ouml;ska. They had not gone far
before they saw before them an immense forest, through which they
wandered all day. Thjalfi was of all men the swiftest of foot. He bore
Thor's wallet, but the forest was a bad place for finding anything
eatable to stow in it. When it became dark, they searched on all sides
for a place where they might pass the night, and at last came to a
very large hall, with an entrance that took up the whole breadth of
one of the ends of the building. Here they chose them a place to sleep
in; but towards midnight were alarmed by an earthquake, which shook
the whole edifice. Thor, rising up, called on his companions to seek
with him a place of safety. On the right they found an adjoining
chamber, into which they entered; but while the others, trembling with
fear, crept into the furthest corner of this retreat, Thor remained at
the doorway with his mallet in his hand, prepared to defend himself
whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5125" id="Page_5125">[Pg 5125]</a></span> might happen. A terrible groaning was heard during the
night, and at dawn of day Thor went out and observed lying near him a
man of enormous bulk, who slept and snored pretty loudly. Thor could
now account for the noise they had heard over night, and girding on
his Belt of Prowess, increased that divine strength which he now stood
in need of. The giant, awakening, rose up, and it is said that for
once in his life Thor was afraid to make use of his mallet, and
contented himself by simply asking the giant his name.</p>

<p>"My name is Skrymir," said the other; "but I need not ask thy name,
for I know thou art the god Thor. But what hast thou done with my
glove?" And stretching out his hand Skrymir picked up his glove, which
Thor then perceived was what they had taken over night for a hall, the
chamber where they had sought refuge being the thumb. Skrymir then
asked whether they would have his fellowship, and Thor consenting, the
giant opened his wallet and began to eat his breakfast. Thor and his
companions having also taken their morning repast, though in another
place, Skrymir proposed that they should lay their provisions
together, which Thor also assented to. The giant then put all the meat
into one wallet, which he slung on his back and went before them,
taking tremendous strides, the whole day, and at dusk sought out for
them a place where they might pass the night, under a large oak-tree.
Skrymir then told them that he would lie down to sleep. "But take ye
the wallet," he added, "and prepare your supper."</p>

<p>Skrymir soon fell asleep, and began to snore strongly, but
incredible though it may appear, it must nevertheless be told
that when Thor came to open the wallet he could not untie a
single knot, nor render a single string looser than it was before.
Seeing that his labor was in vain, Thor became wroth, and
grasping his mallet with both hands while he advanced a step
forward, launched it at the giant's head. Skrymir, awakening,
merely asked whether a leaf had not fallen on his head, and
whether they had supped and were ready to go to sleep. Thor
answered that they were just going to sleep, and so saying, went
and laid himself down under another oak-tree. But sleep came
not that night to Thor, and when he remarked that Skrymir
snored again so loud that the forest re-echoed with the noise, he
arose, and grasping his mallet launched it with such force that
it sunk into the giant's skull up to the handle. Skrymir, awakening,
cried out:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5126" id="Page_5126">[Pg 5126]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's the matter? did an acorn fall on my head? How
fares it with thee, Thor?"</p>

<p>But Thor went away hastily, saying that he had just then
awoke, and that as it was only midnight, there was still time for
sleep. He however resolved that if he had an opportunity of
striking a third blow, it should settle all matters between them.
A little before daybreak he perceived that Skrymir was again
fast asleep, and again grasping his mallet, dashed it with such
violence that it forced its way into the giant's cheek up to the
handle. But Skrymir sat up, and stroking his cheek, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are there any birds perched on this tree? Methought when
I awoke some moss from the branches fell on my head. What!
art thou awake, Thor? Methinks it is time for us to get up and
dress ourselves; but you have not now a long way before you to
the city called Utgard. I have heard you whispering to one
another that I am not a man of small dimensions; but if you
come into Utgard you will see there many men much taller than
myself. Wherefore I advise you, when you come there, not to
make too much of yourselves, for the followers of Utgard-Loki
will not brook the boasting of such mannikins as ye are. The
best thing you could do would probably be to turn back again;
but if you persist in going on, take the road that leads eastward,
for mine now lies northward to those rocks which you may
see in the distance."</p>

<p>Hereupon he threw his wallet over his shoulders and turned
away from them into the forest, and I could never hear that
Thor wished to meet with him a second time.</p>

<p>Thor and his companions proceeded on their way, and towards noon
descried a city standing in the middle of a plain. It was so lofty
that they were obliged to bend their necks quite back on their
shoulders, ere they could see to the top of it. On arriving at the
walls they found the gateway closed, with a gate of bars strongly
locked and bolted. Thor, after trying in vain to open it, crept with
his companions through the bars, and thus succeeded in gaining
admission into the city. Seeing a large palace before them, with the
door wide open, they went in and found a number of men of prodigious
stature sitting on benches in the hall. Going further, they came
before the King, Utgard-Loki, whom they saluted with great respect.
Their salutations were however returned by a contemptuous look from
the King, who after regarding them for some time said with a scornful
smile:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5127" id="Page_5127">[Pg 5127]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is tedious to ask for tidings of a long journey, yet if I do not
mistake me, that stripling there must be Aku-Thor. Perhaps," he added,
addressing himself to Thor, "thou mayest be taller than thou appearest
to be. But what are the feats that thou and thy fellows deem
yourselves skilled in? for no one is permitted to remain here who does
not in some feat or other excel all men."</p>

<p>"The feat I know," replied Loki, "is to eat quicker than any one else;
and in this I am ready to give a proof against any one here who may
choose to compete with me."</p>

<p>"That will indeed be a feat," said Utgard-Loki, "if thou
performest what thou promisest; and it shall be tried forthwith."</p>

<p>He then ordered one of his men, who was sitting at the
further end of the bench, and whose name was Logi, to come
forward and try his skill with Loki. A trough filled with flesh-meat
having been set on the hall floor, Loki placed himself at
one end and Logi at the other, and each of them began to eat
as fast as he could, until they met in the middle of the trough.
But it was soon found that Loki had only eaten the flesh,
whereas his adversary had devoured both flesh and bone, and the
trough to boot. All the company therefore adjudged that Loki
was vanquished.</p>

<p>Utgard-Loki then asked what feat the young man who accompanied Thor
could perform. Thjalfi answered that he would run a race with any one
who might be matched against him. The King observed that skill in
running was something to boast of, but that if the youth would win the
match he must display great agility. He then arose and went with all
who were present to a plain where there was good ground for running
on, and calling a young man named Hugi, bade him run a match with
Thjalfi. In the first course, Hugi so much outstripped his competitor
that he turned back and met him, not far from the starting-place.</p>

<p>"Thou must ply thy legs better, Thjalfi," said Utgard-Loki,
"if thou wilt win the match; though I must needs say that there
never came a man here swifter of foot than thou art."</p>

<p>In the second course, Thjalfi was a full bow-shot from the
goal when Hugi arrived at it.</p>

<p>"Most bravely dost thou run, Thjalfi," said Utgard-Loki,
"though thou wilt not, methinks, win the match. But the third
course must decide."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5128" id="Page_5128">[Pg 5128]</a></span></p>

<p>They accordingly ran a third time, but Hugi had already
reached the goal before Thjalfi had got half-way. All who were
present then cried out that there had been a sufficient trial of
skill in this kind of exercise.</p>

<p>Utgard-Loki then asked Thor in what feats he would choose
to give proofs of that dexterity for which he was so famous.
Thor replied that he would begin a drinking match with any one.
Utgard-Loki consented, and entering the palace, bade his cup-bearer
bring the large horn which his followers were obliged to
drink out of, when they had trespassed in any way against established
usage. The cup-bearer having presented it to Thor, Utgard-Loki said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whoever is a good drinker will empty that horn at a single
draught, though some men make two of it; but the most puny
drinker of all can do it at three."</p>

<p>Thor looked at the horn, which seemed of no extraordinary
size, though somewhat long; however, as he was very thirsty, he
set it to his lips, and without drawing breath, pulled as long and
as deeply as he could, that he might not be obliged to make a
second draught of it; but when he set the horn down and looked
in, he could scarcely perceive that the liquor was diminished.</p>

<p>"'Tis well drunken," exclaimed Utgard-Loki, "though nothing
much to boast of; and I would not have believed, had it been
told me, that Asa-Thor could not take a greater draught; but
thou no doubt meanest to make amends at the second pull."</p>

<p>Thor without answering went at it again with all his might;
but when he took the horn from his mouth it seemed to him as
if he had drunk rather less than before, although the horn could
now be carried without spilling.</p>

<p>"How now! Thor," said Utgard-Loki: "Thou must not spare
thyself more, in performing a feat, than befits thy skill; but if
thou meanest to drain the horn at the third draught thou must
pull deeply; and I must needs say that thou wilt not be called so
mighty a man here as thou art among the &AElig;sir, if thou showest
no greater powers in other feats than methinks will be shown in
this."</p>

<p>Thor, full of wrath, again set the horn to his lips and exerted
himself to the utmost to empty it entirely; but on looking in,
found that the liquor was only a little lower; upon which he
resolved to make no further attempt, but gave back the horn to
the cup-bearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5129" id="Page_5129">[Pg 5129]</a></span></p>

<p>"I now see plainly," said Utgard-Loki, "that thou art not quite
so stout as we thought thee; but wilt thou try any other feat?&mdash;though
methinks thou art not likely to bear any prize away with
thee hence."</p>

<p>"I will try another feat," replied Thor; "and I am sure such
draughts as I have been drinking would not have been reckoned
small among the &AElig;sir; but what new trial hast thou to propose?"</p>

<p>"We have a very trifling game here," answered Utgard-Loki,
"in which we exercise none but children. It consists in merely
lifting my cat from the ground; nor should I have dared to
mention such a feat to Asa-Thor, if I had not already observed
that thou art by no means what we took thee for."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, a large gray cat sprang on the hall
floor. Thor, advancing, put his hand under the cat's belly, and
did his utmost to raise him from the floor; but the cat, bending
his back, had&mdash;notwithstanding all Thor's efforts&mdash;only one of
his feet lifted up; seeing which, Thor made no further attempt.</p>

<p>"This trial has turned out," said Utgard-Loki, "just as I imagined
it would; the cat is large, but Thor is little in comparison
with our men."</p>

<p>"Little as ye call me," answered Thor, "let me see who
amongst you will come hither, now I am in wrath, and wrestle
with me."</p>

<p>"I see no one here," said Utgard-Loki, looking at the men
sitting on the benches, "who would not think it beneath him to
wrestle with thee: let somebody, however, call hither that old
crone, my nurse Elli, and let Thor wrestle with her if he will.
She has thrown to the ground many a man not less strong and
mighty than this Thor is."</p>

<p>A toothless old woman then entered the hall, and was told by
Utgard-Loki to take hold of Thor. The tale is shortly told.
The more Thor tightened his hold on the crone the firmer she
stood. At length, after a very violent struggle, Thor began to
lose his footing, and was finally brought down upon one knee.
Utgard-Loki then told them to desist, adding that Thor had now
no occasion to ask any one else in the hall to wrestle with him,
and it was also getting late. He therefore showed Thor and his
companions to their seats, and they passed the night there in good
cheer.</p>

<p>The next morning, at break of day, Thor and his companions
dressed themselves and prepared for their departure. Utgard-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5130" id="Page_5130">[Pg 5130]</a></span>Loki
then came and ordered a table to be set for them, on which
there was no lack of either victuals or drink. After the repast
Utgard-Loki led them to the gate of the city, and on parting
asked Thor how he thought his journey had turned out, and
whether he had met with any men stronger than himself. Thor
told him that he could not deny but that he had brought great
shame on himself. "And what grieves me most," he added, "is
that ye call me a man of little worth."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Utgard-Loki, "it behoves me to tell thee the
truth, now thou art out of the city; which so long as I live and
have my way thou shalt never re-enter. And by my troth, had
I known beforehand that thou hadst so much strength in thee,
and wouldst have brought me so near to a great mishap, I would
not have suffered thee to enter this time. Know, then, that I
have all along deceived thee by my illusions: first in the forest,
where I arrived before thee, and there thou wert not able to
untie the wallet, because I had bound it with iron wire, in such
a manner that thou couldst not discover how the knot ought to
be loosened. After this, thou gavest me three blows with thy
mallet; the first, though the least, would have ended my days
had it fallen on me, but I brought a rocky mountain before me
which thou didst not perceive, and in this mountain thou wilt
find three glens, one of them remarkably deep. These are the
dints made by thy mallet. I have made use of similar illusions
in the contests ye have had with my followers. In the first,
Loki, like hunger itself, devoured all that was set before him;
but Logi was in reality nothing else than ardent fire, and therefore
consumed not only the meat but the trough which held it.
Hugi, with whom Thjalfi contended in running, was Thought;
and it was impossible for Thjalfi to keep pace with that. When
thou in thy turn didst try to empty the horn, thou didst perform,
by my troth, a deed so marvelous that had I not seen it
myself I should never have believed it. For one end of that
horn reached the sea, which thou wast not aware of, but when
thou comest to the shore thou wilt perceive how much the sea
has sunk by thy draughts, which have caused what is now called
the ebb. Thou didst perform a feat no less wonderful by lifting
up the cat; and to tell thee the truth, when we saw that one of
his paws was off the floor, we were all of us terror-stricken; for
what thou tookest for a cat was in reality the great Midgard
serpent that encompasseth the whole earth, and he was then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5131" id="Page_5131">[Pg 5131]</a></span>
barely long enough to inclose it between his head and tail, so
high had thy hand raised him up towards heaven. Thy wrestling
with Elli was also a most astonishing feat, for there was
never yet a man, nor ever shall be, whom Old Age&mdash;for such
in fact was Elli&mdash;will not sooner or later lay low if he abide
her coming. But now, as we are going to part, let me tell thee
that it will be better for both of us if thou never come near me
again; for shouldst thou do so, I shall again defend myself by
other illusions, so that thou wilt never prevail against me."</p>

<p>On hearing these words, Thor in a rage laid hold of his
mallet and would have launched it at him; but Utgard-Loki had
disappeared, and when Thor would have returned to the city to
destroy it, he found nothing around him but a verdant plain.
Proceeding therefore on his way, he returned without stopping
to Thr&uacute;dv&aacute;ng.</p>

<h2><a name="ALFRED_EDERSHEIM" id="ALFRED_EDERSHEIM"></a>ALFRED EDERSHEIM</h2>

<h4>(1825-1889)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">mong writers on Biblical topics Dr. Alfred Edersheim occupies
a unique place. Bred in the Jewish faith, he brought to his
writings the traditions of his ancestry. The history of the
Children of Israel was a reality to him, who had known the Talmud
and the Old Testament through the lessons of his boyhood, and had
been taught to reverence the Hebrew sacred rites handed down
through the ages. All the intangible, unconscious religious influences
of his youth entered into the work of his manhood. And although
this converted Rabbi wrote as a Christian, yet the Bible stories were
colored and vivified for him by his Jewish sympathies. Thus his
work had the especial value of a double point of view.</p>

<p>Born in Vienna in 1825 of German parents, he studied at the university
of his native city and in Berlin, finishing his theological education
in Edinburgh. He became a minister of the Free Church of
Scotland in 1849, passing over to the Church of England in 1875.
In 1881 he received from Oxford an honorary A.M., and was for a
time lecturer on the Septuagint at the university. He died in Mentone,
France, on March 16th, 1889.</p>

<p>The earlier writings of Dr. Edersheim consist almost entirely of
translations from the German, and of Jewish stories written for educational
purposes. Of his later works the most important are&mdash;'The
Bible History,' his largest work, in seven volumes; 'The Temple, its
Ministers and Services as they were at the Time of Christ'; 'Sketches
of Jewish Social Life in the Days of Christ'; and a 'History of the
Jewish Nation after the Destruction of Jerusalem under Titus.' From
the evangelical point of view, his 'Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah'
is of final authority, brilliantly exemplifying his peculiar fitness
to be the interpreter of Jewish life and thought at the period of the
rise of Christianity. He presents not only the story of the Christ of
the Gospels, but draws a picture of the whole political and social life
of the Jews, and of their intellectual and religious condition&mdash;a picture
which his Rabbinical learning and his race sympathies make
authentic. He wrote English with unaffected directness, embodying
in the simplest forms the results of his wide scholarship. His books
have a very wide and constant sale.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_WASHING_OF_HANDS" id="THE_WASHING_OF_HANDS"></a>THE WASHING OF HANDS</h3>

<h4>From 'The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah'</h4>

<p>The externalism of all these practices [ceremonial practices of
the Hebrews] will best appear from the following account
which the Talmud gives of "a feast." As the guests enter,
they sit down on chairs, and water is brought to them, with
which they wash one hand. Into this the cup is taken, when
each speaks the blessing over the wine partaken of before dinner.
Presently they all lie down at table. Water is again brought
them, with which they now wash both hands, preparatory to
the meal, when the blessing is spoken over the bread, and then
over the cup, by the chief person at the feast, or else by one
selected by way of distinction. The company respond by <i>Amen</i>,
always supposing the benediction to have been spoken by an
Israelite, not a heathen, slave, nor law-breaker. Nor was it lawful
to say it with an unlettered man, although it might be said
with a Cuth&aelig;an (heretic, or Samaritan,) who was learned. After
dinner the crumbs, if any, are carefully gathered&mdash;hands are
again washed, and he who first had done so leads in the prayer
of thanksgiving. The formula in which he is to call on the rest
to join him by repeating the prayers after him is prescribed, and
differs according to the number of those present. The blessing
and the thanksgiving are allowed to be said not only in Hebrew,
but in any other language.</p>

<p>In regard to the position of the guests, we know that the
uppermost seats were occupied by the Rabbis. The Talmud
formulates it in this manner: That the worthiest lies down first,
on his left side, with his feet hanging down. If there are two
"cushions" (divans), the next worthiest lies at his feet; if there
are three cushions, the third worthiest lies above the first (at his
left), so that the chief person is in the middle. The water
before eating is first handed to the worthiest, and so in regard
to the washing after meat. But if a very large number are
present, you begin after dinner with the least worthy till you
come to the last five, when the worthiest in the company washes
his hands, and the other four after him. The guests being thus
arranged, the head of the house, or the chief person at table,
speaks the blessing and then cuts the bread. By some it was
not deemed etiquette to begin till after he who had said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5147" id="Page_5147">[Pg 5147]</a></span>
prayer had done so, but this does not seem to have been the
rule among the Palestinian Jews. Then, generally, the bread
was dipped into salt or something salted, etiquette demanding
that where there were two they should wait one for the other,
but not where there were three or more.</p>

<p>This is not the place to furnish what may be termed a list of
<i>menus</i> at Jewish tables. In earlier times the meal was no doubt
very simple. It became otherwise when intercourse with Rome,
Greece, and the East made the people familiar with foreign luxury,
while commerce supplied its requirements. Indeed, it would
scarcely be possible to enumerate the various articles which seem
to have been imported from different, and even distant, countries.</p>

<p>To begin with: The wine was mixed with water, and indeed,
some thought that the benediction should not be pronounced till
the water had been added to the wine. According to one statement
two parts, according to another three parts, of water were
to be added to the wine. Various vintages are mentioned: among
them a red wine of Saron, and a black wine. Spiced wine was
made with honey and pepper. Another mixture, chiefly used for
invalids, consisted of old wine, water, and balsam; yet another
was "wine of myrrh"; we also read of a wine in which capers
had been soaked. To these we should add wine spiced either
with pepper or with absinthe, and what is described as vinegar, a
cooling drink made either of grapes that had not ripened, or of
the lees. Besides these, palm wine was also in use. Of foreign
drinks, we read of wine from Ammon and from the province
Asia, the latter a kind of "must" boiled down. Wine in ice
came from Lebanon; a certain kind of vinegar from Idum&aelig;a;
beer from Media and Babylon; barley wine (<i>zythos</i>) from Egypt.
Finally, we ought to mention Palestinian apple cider, and the
juice of other fruits. If we adopt the rendering of some, even
liqueurs were known and used.</p>

<p>Long as this catalogue is, that of the various articles of food,
whether native or imported, would occupy a much larger space. Suffice
it that as regarded the various kinds of grain, meat, fish, and
fruits, either in their natural state or preserved, it embraced almost
everything known to the ancient world. At feasts there was an
introductory course, consisting of appetizing salted meat, or of some
light dish. This was followed by the dinner itself, which finished
with dessert (<i>aphikomon</i> or <i>terugima</i>), consisting of pickled
olives, radishes and lettuce, and fruits, among which even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5148" id="Page_5148">[Pg 5148]</a></span> preserved
ginger from India is mentioned. The most diverse and even strange
statements are made as to the healthiness, or the reverse, of certain
articles of diet, especially vegetables. Fish was a favorite dish, and
never wanting at a Sabbath meal. It was a saying that both salt and
water should be taken at every meal, if health was to be preserved.
Condiments, such as mustard or pepper, were to be sparingly used. Very
different were the meals of the poor. Locusts&mdash;fried in flour or
honey, or preserved&mdash;required, according to the Talmud, no blessing;
since the animal was really among the curses of the land. Eggs were a
common article of food, and sold in the shops. Then there was a milk
dish, into which people dipped their bread. Others who were better off
had a soup made of vegetables, especially onions, and meat; while the
very poor would satisfy the cravings of hunger with bread and cheese,
or bread and fruit, or some vegetables, such as cucumbers, lentils,
beans, peas, or onions.</p>

<p>At meals the rules of etiquette were strictly observed, especially as
regarded the sages. Indeed, there are added to the Talmud two
tractates, one describing the general etiquette, the other that of
"sages," of which the title may be translated as 'The Way of the
World' (<i>Derech Erez</i>), being a sort of code of good manners.
According to some, it was not good breeding to speak while eating. The
learned and most honored occupied not only the chief places, but were
sometimes distinguished by a double portion. According to Jewish
etiquette, a guest should conform in everything to his host, even
though it were unpleasant. Although hospitality was the greatest and
most prized social virtue, which, to use a rabbinic expression, might
make every home a sanctuary and every table an altar, an unbidden
guest, or a guest who brought another guest, was proverbially an
unwelcome apparition. Sometimes, by way of self-righteousness, the
poor were brought in, and the best part of the meal ostentatiously
given to them. At ordinary entertainments, people were to help
themselves. It was not considered good manners to drink as soon as you
were asked, but you ought to hold the cup for a little in your hand.
But it would be the height of rudeness either to wipe the plates, to
scrape together the bread, as though you had not had enough to eat, or
to drop it, to the inconvenience of your neighbor. If a piece were
taken out of a dish, it must of course not be put back; still less
must you offer from your cup or plate to your neighbor. From the
almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5149" id="Page_5149">[Pg 5149]</a></span> religious value attaching to bread, we scarcely wonder that
these rules were laid down: not to steady a cup or plate upon bread,
nor to throw away bread, and that after dinner the bread was to be
carefully swept together. Otherwise, it was thought, demons would sit
upon it. 'The Way of the World' for sages lays down these as the marks
of a rabbi: that he does not eat standing; that he does not lick his
fingers; that he sits down only beside his equals&mdash;in fact, many
regarded it as wrong to eat with the unlearned; that he begins cutting
the bread where it is best baked, nor ever breaks off a bit with his
hand; and that when drinking, he turns away his face from the company.
Another saying was, that the sage was known by four things: at his
cups, in money matters, when angry, and in his jokes. After dinner,
the formalities concerning hand-washing and prayer, already described,
were gone through, and then frequently aromatic spices burnt, over
which a special benediction was pronounced. We have only to add that
on Sabbaths it was deemed a religious duty to have three meals, and to
procure the best that money could obtain, even though one were to save
and fast for it all the week. Lastly, it was regarded as a special
obligation and honor to entertain sages.</p>

<p>We have no difficulty now in understanding what passed at the table of
the Pharisee. When the water for purification was presented to him,
Jesus would either refuse it, or if, as seems more likely at a morning
meal, each guest repaired by himself for the prescribed purification,
he would omit to do so, and sit down to meat without this formality.
No one who knows the stress which Pharisaism laid on this rite would
argue that Jesus might have conformed to the practice. Indeed, the
controversy was long and bitter between the Schools of Shammai and
Hillel, on such a point as whether the hands were to be washed
<i>before</i> the cup was filled with wine, or <i>after</i> that, and where the
towel was to be deposited. With such things the most serious ritual
inferences were connected on both sides. A religion which spent its
energy on such trivialities must have lowered the moral tone. All the
more that Jesus insisted so earnestly, as the substance of his
teaching, on that corruption of our nature which Judaism ignored and
on that spiritual purification which was needful for the reception of
his doctrine,&mdash;would he publicly and openly set aside ordinances of
man which diverted thoughts of purity into questions of the most
childish character. On the other hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5150" id="Page_5150">[Pg 5150]</a></span> we can also understand what
bitter thoughts must have filled the mind of the Pharisee whose guest
Jesus was, when he observed his neglect of the cherished rite. It was
an insult to himself, a defiance of Jewish law, a revolt against the
most cherished traditions of the synagogue. Remembering that a
Pharisee ought not to sit down to a meal with such, he might feel that
he should not have asked Jesus to his table.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">he famous author of Irish novels and didactic tales was the daughter
of Richard Lovell Edgeworth and his first wife Anna Ehrs, and was born
at Black Bourton, Oxfordshire, January 1st, 1767. When she was twelve
years old the family settled on the estate at Edgeworth's-town, County
Longford, Ireland, which was her home during the remainder of her long
life. It was a singularly happy family circle, of which Maria was the
centre. Her father married four times, and had twenty-two children, on
whom he exercised his peculiar educational ideas. He devoted himself
most particularly to Maria's training, and made her his most
confidential companion. Several of her works were written in
conjunction with her father, and over almost all he exercised a
supervision which doubtless hindered the free expression of her
genius. Her first publication, 'Letters to Literary Ladies,' on the
education of women, appeared in 1795. This was followed by educational
and juvenile works illustrating the theories of Mr. Edgeworth: 'The
Parent's Assistant,' 'Practical Education' (a joint production),
supplemented later by 'Early Lessons'; 'Rosamond,' 'Harry and Lucy,'
and a sequel to the 'Parent's Assistant.' In 1800 appeared 'Castle
Rackrent,' the first of her novels of Irish life, and her best known
work; soon followed by 'Belinda,' and the well-known 'Essay on Irish
Bulls,' by her father and herself. Miss Edgeworth's reputation was now
established, and on a visit to Paris at this time she received much
attention. Here occurred the one recorded romance of her life, the
proposal of marriage from Count Edelcrantz, a Swedish gentleman. On
her return she wrote 'Leonora.' In 1804 she published 'Popular Tales';
in 1809 the first series of 'Fashionable Tales.' These tales include
'Almeria' and 'The Absentee,' considered by many critics her
masterpiece. 'Patronage' was begun years before as 'The Freeman
Family.' In 1817 she published 'Harrington' and 'Ormond,' which rank
among her best works. In the same year her father died, leaving to her
the completion of his 'Memoirs,' which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5152" id="Page_5152">[Pg 5152]</a></span>appeared in 1820. Her last
novel, 'Helen,' published in 1834, shows no diminution of her charm
and grace. With occasional visits to Paris and London, and a memorable
trip to Scotland in 1823, when she was entertained at Abbotsford, she
lived serene and happy at Edgeworth's-town until her sudden death, May
21st 1849.</p>

</div>

<p>Miss Edgeworth was extremely small, not beautiful; but a brilliant
talker and a great favorite in the exclusive society to which she
everywhere had access. Her greatest success was in the new field
opened in her Irish stories, full of racy, rollicking Irish humor, and
valuable pictures of bygone conditions, for the genial peasant of her
pages is now rarely found. Not the least we owe her is the influence
which her national tales had on Sir Walter Scott, who declared that
her success led him to do the same for his own country in the Waverley
Novels. Miss Edgeworth's style is easy and animated. Her tales show
her extraordinary power of observation, her good sense, and remarkable
skill in dialogue, though they are biased by the didactic purpose
which permeates all her writings. As Madame de Sta&euml;l remarked, she was
"lost in dreary utility." And doubtless this is why she just missed
greatness, and has been consigned to the ranks of "standard" authors
who are respectfully alluded to but seldom read. The lack of
tenderness and imagination was perhaps the result of her unusual
self-control, shown in her custom of writing in the family
sitting-room, and so concentrating her mind on her work that she was
deaf to all that went on about her. Surely some of the creative power
of her mind must have been lost in that strenuous effort. Her noble
character, as well as her talents, won for her the friendship of many
distinguished people of her day. With Scott she was intimate, Byron
found her charming, and Macaulay was an enthusiastic admirer. In her
recently edited letters are found many interesting and valuable
accounts of the people she met in the course of her long life.</p>

<p>Miss Edgeworth's life has been written by Helen Zimmern and Grace A.
Oliver; her 'Life and Letters,' edited by Augustus J. C. Hare,
appeared in 1895. 'Pen Portraits of Literary Women,' by Helen Gray

<h3><a name="SIR_CONDYS_WAKE" id="SIR_CONDYS_WAKE"></a>SIR CONDY'S WAKE</h3>

<h4>From 'Castle Rackrent'</h4>

<p>When they were made sensible that Sir Condy was going to leave Castle
Rackrent for good and all, they set up a whillaluh that could be heard
to the farthest end of the street; and one fine boy he was, that my
master had given an apple to that morning, cried the loudest; but they
all were the same sorry, for Sir Condy was greatly beloved among the
childher, for letting them go a-nutting in the demesne without saying
a word to them, though my lady objected to them. The people in the
town, who were the most of them standing at their doors, hearing the
childher cry, would know the reason of it; and when the report was
made known the people one and all gathered in great anger against my
son Jason, and terror at the notion of his coming to be landlord over
them, and they cried, "No Jason! no Jason! Sir Condy! Sir Condy! Sir
Condy Rackrent forever!" and the mob grew so great and so loud I was
frightened, and made my way back to the house to warn my son to make
his escape or hide himself, for fear of the consequences. Jason would
not believe me till they came all round the house and to the windows
with great shouts; then he grew quite pale, and asked Sir Condy what
had he best do? "I'll tell you what you'd best do," said Sir Condy,
who was laughing to see his fright: "finish your glass first; then
let's go to the window and show ourselves, and I'll tell 'em, or you
shall if you please, that I'm going to the lodge for change of air for
my health, and by my own desire, for the rest of my days." "Do so,"
said Jason who never meant it should have been so, but could not
refuse him the lodge at this unseasonable time. Accordingly Sir Condy
threw up the sash and explained matters, and thanked all his friends,
and bid 'em look in at the punch-bowl, and observe that Jason and he
had been sitting over it very good friends; so the mob was content,
and he sent 'em out some whisky to drink his health, and that was the
last time his Honor's health was ever drunk at Castle Rackrent.</p>

<p>The very next day, being too proud, as he said to me, to stay an hour
longer in a house that did not belong to him, he sets off to the
lodge, and I along with him not many hours after. And there was great
bemoaning through all O'Shaughlin's Town,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5154" id="Page_5154">[Pg 5154]</a></span> which I stayed to witness,
and gave my poor master a full account of when I got to the lodge. He
was very low and in his bed when I got there, and complained of a
great pain about his heart; but I guessed it was only trouble, and all
the business, let alone vexation, he had gone through of late; and
knowing the nature of him from a boy, I took my pipe, and while
smoking it by the chimney, began telling him how he was beloved and
regretted in the county, and it did him a deal of good to hear it.
"Your Honor has a great many friends yet, that you don't know of, rich
and poor in the country," says I; "for as I was coming along the road,
I met two gentlemen in their own carriages, who asked after you,
knowing me, and wanted to know where you was, and all about you, and
even how old I was: think of that!" Then he wakened out of his doze,
and began questioning me who the gentlemen were. And the next morning
it came into my head to go, unknown to anybody, with my master's
compliments, round to many of the gentlemen's houses where he and my
lady used to visit, and people that I knew were his great friends, and
would go to Cork to serve him any day in the year, and I made bold to
try to borrow a trifle of cash from them. They all treated me very
civil for the most part, and asked a great many questions very kind
about my lady and Sir Condy and all the family, and were greatly
surprised to learn from me Castle Rackrent was sold, and my master at
the lodge for health; and they all pitied him greatly, and he had
their good wishes, if that would do, but money was a thing they
unfortunately had not any of them at this time to spare. I had my
journey for my pains, and I, not used to walking, nor supple as
formerly, was greatly tired, but had the satisfaction of telling my
master, when I got to the lodge, all the civil things said by high and
low.</p>

<p>"Thady," says he, "all you've been telling me brings a strange thought
into my head: I've a notion I shall not be long for this world anyhow,
and I've a great fancy to see my own funeral afore I die." I was
greatly shocked at the first speaking, to hear him speak so light
about his funeral, and he to all appearances in good health, but
recollecting myself answered:&mdash;"To be sure it would be as fine a sight
as one could see, I dared to say, and one I should be proud to
witness; and I did not doubt his Honor's would be as great a funeral
as ever Sir Patrick O'Shaughlin's was, and such a one as that had
never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5155" id="Page_5155">[Pg 5155]</a></span> been known in the county before or since." But I never thought
he was in earnest about seeing his own funeral himself, till the next
day he returns to it again. "Thady," says he, "as far as the wake
goes, sure I might without any great trouble have the satisfaction of
seeing a bit of my own funeral." "Well, since your Honor's Honor's so
bent upon it," says I, not willing to cross him, and he in trouble,
"we must see what we can do." So he fell into a sort of a sham
disorder, which was easy done, as he kept his bed and no one to see
him; and I got my shister, who was an old woman very handy about the
sick, and very skillful, to come up to the lodge to nurse him; and we
gave out, she knowing no better, that he was just at his latter end,
and it answered beyond anything; and there was a great throng of
people, men, women, and children, and there being only two rooms at
the lodge, except what was locked up full of Jason's furniture and
things, the house was soon as full and fuller than it could hold, and
the heat and smoke and noise wonderful great; and standing among them
that were near the bed, but not thinking at all of the dead, I was
startled by the sound of my master's voice from under the greatcoats
that had been thrown all at top, and I went close up, no one noticing.
"Thady," says he, "I've had enough of this; I'm smothering, and can't
hear a word of all they're saying of the deceased." "God bless you,
and lie still and quiet," says I, "a bit longer; for my shister's
afraid of ghosts and would die on the spot with fright, was she to see
you come to life all on a sudden this way without the least
preparation." So he lays him still, though well-nigh stifled, and I
made all haste to tell the secret of the joke, whispering to one and
t'other, and there was a great surprise, but not so great as we had
laid out it would. "And aren't we to have the pipes and tobacco, after
coming so far to-night?" said some; but they were all well enough
pleased when his Honor got up to drink with them, and sent for more
spirits from a shebean-house, where they very civilly let him have it
upon credit. So the night passed off very merrily, but to my mind Sir
Condy was rather upon the sad order in the midst of it all, not
finding there had been such a great talk about himself after his death
as he had always expected to hear.</p>

<h3><a name="SIR_MURTAGH_RACKRENT_AND_HIS_LADY" id="SIR_MURTAGH_RACKRENT_AND_HIS_LADY"></a>SIR MURTAGH RACKRENT AND HIS LADY</h3>

<h4>From 'Castle Rackrent'</h4>

<p>Now it was that the world was to see what was <i>in</i> Sir Patrick.
On coming into the estate he gave the finest entertainment
ever was heard of in the country; not a man could stand
after supper but Sir Patrick himself, who could sit out the best
man in Ireland, let alone the three kingdoms itself. He had his
house, from one year's end to another, as full of company as
ever it could hold, and fuller; for rather than be left out of the
parties at Castle Rackrent, many gentlemen, and those men of the
first consequence and landed estates in the country,&mdash;such as the
O'Neils of Ballynagrotty, and the Moneygawls of Mount Juliet's
Town, and O'Shannons of New Town Tullyhog,&mdash;made it their
choice often and often, when there was no moon to be had for
love nor money, in long winter nights, to sleep in the chicken-house,
which Sir Patrick had fitted up for the purpose of accommodating
his friends and the public in general, who honored him with their
company unexpectedly at Castle Rackrent; and this went on I can't tell
you how long: the whole country rang with his praises&mdash;long life to
him! I'm sure I love to look upon his picture, now opposite to me;
though I never saw him, he must have been a portly gentleman&mdash;his neck
something short, and remarkable for the largest pimple on his nose,
which by his particular desire is still extant in his picture, said to
be a striking likeness though taken when young. He is said also to be
the inventor of raspberry whisky; which is very likely, as nobody has
ever appeared to dispute it with him, and as there still exists a
broken punch-bowl at Castle Rackrent in the garret, with an
inscription to that effect&mdash;a great curiosity. A few days before his
death he was very merry; it being his Honor's birthday, he called my
grandfather in, God bless him! to drink the company's health, and
filled a bumper himself, but could not carry it to his head on account
of the great shake in his hand; on this he cast his joke,
saying:&mdash;"What would my poor father say to me if he was to pop out of
the grave and see me now? I remember when I was a little boy, the
first bumper of claret he gave me after dinner, how he praised me for
carrying it so steady to my mouth. Here's my thanks to him&mdash;a bumper
toast." Then he fell to singing the favorite song he learned from his
father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5157" id="Page_5157">[Pg 5157]</a></span> for the last time, poor gentleman; he sung it that night as
loud and as hearty as ever, with a chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He that goes to bed, and goes to bed sober,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Falls as the leaves do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls as the leaves do, and dies in October;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he that goes to bed, and goes to bed mellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lives as he ought to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives as he ought to do, and dies an honest fellow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Patrick died that night: just as the company rose to drink his
health with three cheers, he fell down in a sort of fit, and was
carried off; they sat it out, and were surprised, on inquiry in the
morning, to find that it was all over with poor Sir Patrick. Never did
any gentleman live and die more beloved in the country by rich and
poor. His funeral was such a one as was never known before or since in
the county! All the gentlemen in the three counties were at it; far
and near, how they flocked! My great-grandfather said that to see all
the women even in their red cloaks, you would have taken them for the
army drawn out. Then such a fine whillaluh! you might have heard it to
the farthest end of the county, and happy the man who could get but a
sight of the hearse! But who'd have thought it? just as all was going
on right, through his own town they were passing, when the body was
seized for debt: a rescue was apprehended from the mob, but the heir,
who attended the funeral, was against that for fear of consequences,
seeing that those villains who came to serve acted under the disguise
of the law; so, to be sure, the law must take its course, and little
gain had the creditors for their pains. First and foremost, they had
the curses of the country; and Sir Murtagh Rackrent, the new heir, in
the next place, on account of this affront to the body, refused to pay
a shilling of the debts, in which he was countenanced by all the best
gentlemen of property, and others of his acquaintance. Sir Murtagh
alleging in all companies, that he all along meant to pay his father's
debts of honor, but the moment the law was taken of him there was an
end of honor to be sure. It was whispered (but none but the enemies of
the family believed it) that this was all a sham seizure to get quit
of the debts, which he had bound himself to pay in honor.</p>

<p>It's a long time ago, there's no saying how it was, but this for
certain: the new man did not take at all after the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5158" id="Page_5158">[Pg 5158]</a></span> gentleman; the
cellars were never filled after his death, and no open house or
anything as it used to be; the tenants even were sent away without
their whisky. I was ashamed myself, and knew not what to say for the
honor of the family; but I made the best of a bad case, and laid it
all at my lady's door, for I did not like her anyhow, nor anybody
else; she was of the family of the Skinflints, and a widow; it was a
strange match for Sir Murtagh; the people in the country thought he
demeaned himself greatly, but I said nothing: I knew how it was; Sir
Murtagh was a great lawyer, and looked to the great Skinflint estate;
there however he overshot himself; for though one of the co-heiresses,
he was never the better for her, for she outlived him many's the long
day&mdash;he could not see that, to be sure, when he married her. I must
say for her, she made him the best of wives, being a very notable
stirring woman, and looking close to everything. But I always
suspected she had Scotch blood in her veins; anything else I could
have looked over in her from a regard to the family. She was a strict
observer for self and servants of Lent, and all fast days, but not
holy days. One of the maids having fainted three time the last day of
Lent, to keep soul and body together we put a morsel of roast beef in
her mouth, which came from Sir Murtagh's dinner,&mdash;who never fasted,
not he; but somehow or other it unfortunately reached my lady's ears,
and the priest of the parish had a complaint made of it the next day,
and the poor girl was forced as soon as she could walk to do penance
for it, before she could get any peace or absolution, in the house or
out of it. However, my lady was very charitable in her own way. She
had a charity school for poor children, where they were taught to read
and write gratis, and where they were kept well to spinning gratis for
my lady in return; for she had always heaps of duty yarn from the
tenants, and got all her household linen out of the estate from first
to last; for after the spinning, the weavers on the estate took it in
hand for nothing, because of the looms my lady's interest could get
from the linen board to distribute gratis. Then there was a
bleach-yard near us, and the tenant dare refuse my lady nothing, for
fear of a law suit Sir Murtagh kept hanging over him about the
water-course.</p>

<p>With these ways of managing, 'tis surprising how cheap my lady got
things done, and how proud she was of it. Her table, the same way,
kept for next to nothing,&mdash;duty fowls, and duty turkeys, and duty
geese came as fast as we could eat 'em, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5159" id="Page_5159">[Pg 5159]</a></span> my lady kept a sharp
lookout, and knew to a tub of butter everything the tenants had, all
round. They knew her way, and what with fear of driving for rent and
Sir Murtagh's lawsuits, they were kept in such good order, they never
thought of coming near Castle Rackrent without a present of something
or other&mdash;nothing too much or too little for my lady: eggs, honey,
butter, meal, fish, game, grouse, and herrings, fresh or salt, all
went for something. As for their young pigs, we had them, and the best
bacon and hams they could make up, with all young chickens in spring;
but they were a set of poor wretches, and we had nothing but
misfortunes with them, always breaking and running away. This, Sir
Murtagh and my lady said, was all their former landlord Sir Patrick's
fault, who let 'em all get the half-year's rent into arrear; there was
something in that, to be sure. But Sir Murtagh was as much the
contrary way; for let alone making English tenants of them, every
soul, he was always driving and driving and pounding and pounding, and
canting and canting and replevying and replevying, and he made a good
living of trespassing cattle; there was always some tenant's pig, or
horse, or cow, or calf, or goose trespassing, which was so great a
gain to Sir Murtagh that he did not like to hear me talk of repairing
fences. Then his heriots and duty work brought him in something; his
turf was cut, his potatoes set and dug, his hay brought home, and in
short, all the work about his house done for nothing; for in all our
leases there were strict clauses heavy with penalties, which Sir
Murtagh knew well how to enforce: so many days' duty work of man and
horse from every tenant he was to have, and had, every year; and when
a man vexed him, why, the finest day he could pitch on, when the
cratur was getting in his own harvest, or thatching his cabin, Sir
Murtagh made it a principle to call upon him and his horse; so he
taught 'em all, as he said, to know the law of landlord and tenant.</p>

<p>As for law, I believe no man, dead or alive, ever loved it so well as
Sir Murtagh. He had once sixteen suits pending at a time, and I never
saw him so much himself; roads, lanes, bogs, wells, ponds, eel weirs,
orchards, trees, tithes, vagrants, gravel pits, sand pits, dung-hills,
and nuisances,&mdash;everything upon the face of the earth furnished him
good matter for a suit. He used to boast that he had a law suit for
every letter in the alphabet. How I used to wonder to see Sir Murtagh
in the midst of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5160" id="Page_5160">[Pg 5160]</a></span> papers in his office! Why, he could hardly turn
about for them. I made bold to shrug my shoulders once in his
presence, and thank my stars I was not born a gentleman to so much
toil and trouble; but Sir Murtagh took me up short with his old
proverb, "Learning is better than house or land." Out of forty-nine
suits which he had, he never lost one but seventeen; the rest he
gained with costs, double costs, treble costs sometimes; but even that
did not pay. He was a very learned man in the law, and had the
character of it; but how it was I can't tell, these suits that he
carried cost him a power of money: in the end he sold some hundreds a
year of the family estate: but he was a very learned man in the law,
and I know nothing of the matter, except having a great regard for the
family; and I could not help grieving when he sent me to post up
notices of the sale of the fee-simple of the lands and appurtenances
of Timoleague. "I know, honest Thady," says he to comfort me, "what
I'm about better than you do; I'm only selling to get the ready money
wanting to carry on my suit with spirit with the Nugents of
Carrickashaughlin."</p>

<p>He was very sanguine about that suit with the Nugents of
Carrickashaughlin. He could have gained it, they say, for certain, had
it pleased Heaven to have spared him to us, and it would have been at
the least a plump two thousand a year in his way; but things were
ordered otherwise,&mdash;for the best, to be sure. He dug up a fairy mount
against my advice, and had no luck afterward. Though a learned man in
the law, he was a little too incredulous in other matters. I warned
him that I heard the very Banshee that my grandfather heard under Sir
Patrick's window a few days before his death. But Sir Murtagh thought
nothing of the Banshee, nor of his cough with a spitting of
blood,&mdash;brought on, I understand, by catching cold in attending the
courts, and overstraining his chest with making himself heard in one
of his favorite causes. He was a great speaker, with a powerful voice;
but his last speech was not in the courts at all. He and my lady,
though both of the same way of thinking in some things, and though she
was as good a wife and great economist as you could see, and he the
best of husbands as to looking into his affairs, and making money for
his family,&mdash;yet I don't know how it was, they had a great deal of
sparring and jarring between them. My lady had her privy purse, and
she had her weed ashes, and her sealing money upon the signing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5161" id="Page_5161">[Pg 5161]</a></span> of all
the leases, with something to buy gloves besides; and besides, again,
often took money from the tenants, if offered properly, to speak for
them to Sir Murtagh about abatements and renewals. Now the weed ashes
and the glove money he allowed her clear perquisites; though once when
he saw her in a new gown saved out of the weed ashes, he told her to
my face (for he could say a sharp thing) that she should not put on
her weeds before her husband's death. But in a dispute about an
abatement, my lady would have the last word, and Sir Murtagh grew mad;
I was within hearing of the door, and now I wish I had made bold to
step in. He spoke so loud the whole kitchen was out on the stairs. All
on a sudden he stopped, and my lady too. Something has surely
happened, thought I&mdash;and so it was, for Sir Murtagh in his passion
broke a blood-vessel, and all the law in the land could do nothing in
that case. My lady sent for five physicians, but Sir Murtagh died, and
was buried. She had a fine jointure settled upon her, and took herself
away, to the great joy of the tenantry. I never said anything one way
or the other, while she was part of the family, but got up to see her
go at three o'clock in the morning. "It's a fine morning, honest
Thady," says she; "good-by to ye," and into the carriage she stepped,
without a word more, good or bad, or even half a crown; but I made my
bow, and stood to see her safe out of sight, for the sake of the
family.</p>

<h2><a name="ANNE_CHARLOTTE_LEFFLER_EDGREN" id="ANNE_CHARLOTTE_LEFFLER_EDGREN"></a>ANNE CHARLOTTE LEFFLER EDGREN</h2>

<h4>(1849-1892)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capa.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p class="dropcap">nne Charlotte Leffler Edgren, afterwards Duchess of Cajanello, was
born in Stockholm, October 1st, 1849. She was the most prominent among
contemporary women writers of Sweden, and won for herself an eminent
position in the world of letters, not only for the truthfulness of her
delineation of life, but for the brilliancy of her style and her skill
in using her material. The circumstances of her early life were
comfortable and commonplace. She was the only daughter of a Swedish
rector, and from her mother, also the daughter of a clergyman, she
inherited her literary tendencies. From her parents and her three
devoted brothers she received every encouragement, but with wise
foresight they restrained her desire to publish her early writings;
and it was not until her talent was fully developed that her first
book, a collection of stories entitled 'H&auml;ndelsvis' (By Chance),
appeared in 1869, under the pseudonym of "Carlot." In 1872 she was
married to Gustav Edgren, secretary of the prefecture in Stockholm;
and though fitting and harmonious, this marriage was undoubtedly one
of convenience, brought about by the altered circumstances of her
life.</p>

<p>In 1873 she published the drama 'Sk&aring;despelerskan' (The Actress),
which held the stage in Stockholm for an entire winter, and this was
followed by 'Pastorsadjunkten' (The Curate), 1876, and 'Elfvan' (The
Elf), 1880, the latter being even more than usually successful. Her
equipment as a dramatist was surprisingly slender, as until the time
of her engagement to Mr. Edgren she had never visited the theatre,
and necessarily was absolutely ignorant of the technique of the stage.
Nevertheless, her natural dramatic instincts supplied the defects of a
lack of training, and her plays met with almost universal success.
The theme of all her dramas, under various guises, is the same,&mdash;the
struggle of a woman's individuality with the conventional environment
of her life. Mrs. Edgren herself laments that she was born a woman,
when nature had so evidently intended her for a man.</p>

<p>Her first work to be published under her own name was in 1882,&mdash;a
collection of tales entitled 'Ur Lifvet' (From Life), which were
received with especial applause. Her works were translated into
Danish, Russian, and German, and she now became widely known
as one of the most talented of Swedish writers. In 1883 appeared a
second volume of 'From Life'; and still later, in 1889, yet another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5163" id="Page_5163">[Pg 5163]</a></span>under the same title. These later stories betrayed a boldness of
thought and expression not before evinced, and placed the author
in the ranks of the radicals. The drama 'Sanna Kvinnor' (Ideal
Women) appeared in 1883; 'Huru Man G&ouml;r Godt' (How We do Good)
in 1885; and in 1888, in collaboration with S&oacute;nya Koval&eacute;vsky, 'Kampen
f&ouml;r Lyckan' (The Struggle for Happiness).</p>

<p>In company with her brother, Professor Mittag-Leffler, she attended
a Mathematical Congress in Algiers, in the early part of the year
1888; and upon the return journey through Italy she made the acquaintance
of Signor Pasquale del Pezzo, subsequently Duke of Cajanello,
a mathematician and friend of her brother, and professor in
the University of Naples. Mrs. Edgren was married to the Duke of
Cajanello in 1890, after the dissolution of her marriage with Mr.
Edgren. After this event she published a romance which attracted
a great deal of attention, called 'Kvinlighet och Erotik' (Womanliness
and Erotics), 1890, and among others the drama 'Familjelycka'
(Domestic Happiness), and 'En R&auml;ddende Engel' (A Rescuing Angel),
with which last she achieved her greatest dramatic success. Her last
work was a biography of her intimate friend S&oacute;nya Koval&eacute;vsky.
While in the midst of her literary labors, and in the fullness of her
powers, she died suddenly at Naples, October 21st, 1893.</p>

<p>The subjects of her writings are the deepest questions of life.
Her special theme is the relation between men and women, and in
her studies of the question she has given to the world a series of
types of wonderful vividness and accuracy. The life that she knows
best is the social life of the upper classes; and in all her work, but
particularly in her dramas, she treats its problems with a masculine
vigor and strength. Realism sometimes overshadows poetry, but the
faithfulness of her work is beyond question.</p>

<h3><a name="OPEN_SESAME" id="OPEN_SESAME"></a>OPEN SESAME</h3>

<p>"It was once upon a time"&mdash;so the fairy stories begin.</p>

<p>At that particular time there was a government clerk, not
precisely young, and a little moth-eaten in appearance, who
was on his way home from the office the day after his wedding.</p>

<p>On the wedding day itself he had also sat in the office and
written until three o'clock. After this he had gone out, and as
usual eaten his frugal midday meal at an unpretending restaurant
in a narrow street, and then had gone home to his upper chamber
in an old house in the &Ouml;sterl&aring;nggata, in order to get his
somewhat worn dress coat, which had done good and faithful service
for twelve years. He had speculated a good deal about buying
a new coat for his wedding day, but had at last arrived at
the conclusion that, all in all, it would be a superfluous luxury.</p>

<p>The bride was a telegraph operator, somewhat weakly, and
nervous from labor and want, and of rather an unattractive exterior.
The wedding took place in all quietness at the house of
the bride's old unmarried aunt, who lived in S&ouml;der. The bride
had on a black-silk dress, and the newly married pair drove
home in a droschke.</p>

<p>So the wedding day had passed, but now it was the day after.
From ten o'clock on he had sat in his office, just as on all other
days. Now he was on the way home&mdash;his own home!</p>

<p>That was a strange feeling; indeed, it was such an overpowering
feeling that he stood still many times on the way and fell
into a brown study.</p>

<p>A memory of childhood came into his mind.</p>

<p>He saw himself as a little boy, sitting at his father's desk in
the little parsonage, reading fairy tales. How many times had he
read, again and again, his favorite story out of the Arabian
Nights of 'Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves!' How his heart
had beaten in longing suspense, when he stood with the hero of
the story outside the closed door of the mountain and called,
first gently and a little anxiously, afterwards loudly and boldly:
"Sesame, Sesame! Open Sesame!"</p>

<p>And when the mountain opened its door, what splendor! The poor room of
the parsonage was transformed into the rich treasure chamber of the
mountain, and round about on the walls gleamed the most splendid
jewels. There were, besides horses and carriages, beautifully rigged
ships, weapons, armor&mdash;all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5165" id="Page_5165">[Pg 5165]</a></span> best that a child's fantasy could
dream. His old father looked in astonishment at his youngest child, it
was so long since he himself had been a child, and all the others were
already grown up. He did not understand him, but asked him half
reprovingly what he was thinking about, that his eyes glistened so.</p>

<p>Thus he also came to think about his youth, about his student years at
Upsala. He was a poet, a singer; he had the name of being greatly
gifted, and stood high in his comrades' estimation. What if any one
had told him at that time that he should end as a petty government
clerk, be married to a telegraph operator, and live in the
Repslagaregata in S&ouml;der! Bah! Life had a thousand possibilities. The
future's perspective was illimitable. Nothing was impossible. No honor
was so great that he could not attain it; no woman so beautiful that
he could not win her. What did it signify that he was poor, that he
was only named Andersson, and that he was the eighth child of a poor
parson, who himself was peasant-born? Had not most of the nation's
gifted men sprung from the ranks of the people? Yes, his endowments,
they were the magic charm, the "Open Sesame!" which were to admit him
to all the splendors of life.</p>

<p>As to how things, later on, had gone with him, he did not
allow himself to think. Either his endowments had not been as
great as he had believed, or the difficulties of living had stifled
them, or fortune had not been with him: enough, it had happened
to him as to Ali Baba's wicked brother Casim, who stood
inside the mountain only to find out to his horror that he had
forgotten the magic charm, and in the anguish of death beat
about in his memory to recall it. That was a cruel time&mdash;but
it was not worth while now to think about it longer.</p>

<p>Rapidly one thought followed upon another in his mind. Now
he came to think upon the crown princess, who had made a royal
entrance into the capital just at this time. He had received permission
to accompany his superiors and stand in the festal pavilion
when she landed. That was a glorious moment. The poet's
gifts of his youth were not far from awakening again in the
exaltation of the moment; and had he still been the young
applauding poet of earlier days, instead of the neglected government
clerk, he would probably have written a festal poem and
sent it to the Post.</p>

<p>For it was fine to be the Princess Victoria at that moment.
It was one of the occasions that life has not many of. To be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5166" id="Page_5166">[Pg 5166]</a></span>
nineteen years old, newly married to a young husband, loved and
loving, and to make a ceremonious entry into one's future capital,
which is in festal array and lies fabulously beautiful in the
autumn sun, to be greeted with shouts of joy by countless
masses of men, and to be so inexperienced in life that one has
no presentiment of the shadows which hide themselves back of
this bright picture&mdash;yes, that might indeed be an unforgettable
moment; one of those that only fall to the lot of few mortals, so
that they seem to belong more to the world of fable than to
reality! Had the magic charm, "Open Sesame!" conjured up
anything more beautiful?</p>

<p>And yet! yet!&mdash;The government clerk had neared his home and stood in
front of his own door. No, the crown prince was surely not happier
when he led his bride into his rejoicing capital, than was he at this
moment. He had found again the long-lost magic charm. The little knob
there on the door&mdash;that was his "Open Sesame!" He needed only to press
upon it, when the mountain would again open its treasures to him&mdash;not
weapons and gleaming armor as in his childhood&mdash;not honors and homage
and social position as in his youth&mdash;no, something better than all
these. Something that forms the kernel itself of all human happiness,
upon the heights of life as well as in its most concealed
hiding-places&mdash;a heart that only beat for him, his own home, where
there was one who longed for him&mdash;a wife! Yes, a wife whom he loved,
not with the first passion of youth, but with the tenderness and
faithfulness of manhood.</p>

<p>He stood outside his own door; he was tired and hungry, and his wife
waited for him at the midday meal; that was, to be sure, commonplace
and unimportant&mdash;and yet it was so wonderfully new and attractive.</p>

<p>Gently, cautiously as a child who had been given a new plaything, he
pressed upon the little knob on the door&mdash;and then he stood still with
restrained breath and listened for the light quick step that
approached.</p>

<p>It was just as though in his childhood he stood outside the mountain
and called, first gently and half in fear, and then loudly and with a
voice trembling with glad expectation, "Sesame, Sesame! Open Sesame!"</p>

<h3><a name="A_BALL_IN_HIGH_LIFE" id="A_BALL_IN_HIGH_LIFE"></a>A BALL IN HIGH LIFE</h3>

<h4>From 'A Rescuing Angel'</h4>

<p>The counselor's wife sat down on the sofa with her hands
folded in her lap. Arla remained standing a little farther
away, so that the green lamp-shade left her face in shadow.</p>

<p>"My little girl," began her mother in a mild voice, "do not
feel hurt, but I must make a few remarks on your behavior
to-night. First of all, you will have to hold yourself a little
straighter when you dance. This tendency to droop the head
looks very badly. I noticed it especially when you danced with
Captain Lagerski&ouml;ld&mdash;and do you know, it looked almost as if
you were leaning your head against his shoulder."</p>

<p>Arla blushed; she did not know why, but this reproach hurt
her deeply.</p>

<p>"The dancing-teacher always said that to dance well one must
lean toward one's partner," she objected in a raised voice.</p>

<p>"If that is so, it is better not to dance so well," answered her
mother seriously. "And another thing. I heard you ask Mr.
&Ouml;rn to excuse you. And you danced the cotillon after all."</p>

<p>"I suppose one has a right to dance with whom one pleases."</p>

<p>"One never has a right to hurt others; and besides, you said
to Mr. &Ouml;rn that you were tired out and not able to dance again.
How could you then immediately after&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Captain Lagerski&ouml;ld leads so well," she said, lifting her head,
and her mother saw that her eyes were shining. "To dance
with him is no exertion."</p>

<p>Her mother seemed inclined to say something, but hesitated.</p>

<p>"Come a little nearer," she said. "Let me look at you."</p>

<p>Arla came up, knelt down on a footstool, hid her face in her
mother's dress, and began to cry softly.</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell you, then," said her mother, smoothing her hair.
"Poor child, don't give yourself up to these dreams. Captain
Lagerski&ouml;ld is the kind of a man that I should have preferred never to
have asked to our house. He is a man entirely without character and
principles&mdash;to be frank, a bad man."</p>

<p>Arla raised her tear-stained face quickly.</p>

<p>"I know that," she said almost triumphantly. "He told me so himself."</p>

<p>Her mother was silent with astonishment, and Aria continued,
rising, "He has never had any parents nor any home, but has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5168" id="Page_5168">[Pg 5168]</a></span>
always been surrounded with temptations. And," she went on
in a lower voice, "he has never found any one that he could
really love, and it is only through love that he can be rescued
from the dark powers that have ruled his life."</p>

<p>She repeated almost word for word what he had said. He had expressed
himself in so commonplace a way, and she was so far from suspecting
what his confession really meant, that she would not have been able to
clothe them in her own words. She had only a vague impression that he
was unhappy and sinful&mdash;and that she should save him. Sinful was to
her a mere abstract idea: everybody was full of sin, and his sin was
very likely that he lived without God. He had perhaps never learned to
pray, and maybe he never went to church or took the communion. She
knew that there were men who never did. And then perhaps he had been
engaged to Cecilia, and had broken the engagement when he saw that he
did not really love her.</p>

<p>"And all this he has told you already!" exclaimed her mother, when she
got over her first surprise. "Well then, I can also guess what he said
further. Do you want me to tell you? You are the first girl he has
really loved&mdash;you are to be his rescuing angel&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arla made a faint exclamation.</p>

<p>"You do not suppose I have been listening?" asked her mother. "I know
it without that; men like this always speak so when they want to win
an innocent girl. When I was young I had an admirer of this kind&mdash;that
is not an uncommon experience."</p>

<p>Not uncommon! These words were not said to her only; other men had
said the same before this to other young girls! Oh! but not in the
same way, at any rate! thought Arla. As he had said them&mdash;with such a
look&mdash;such a voice&mdash;no, nobody else could ever have done that.</p>

<p>"And you didn't understand that a man who can make a young girl a
declaration of love the first time he sees her must be superficial and
not to be trusted?" continued her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma does not know what love is," thought Aria. "She does not know
that it is born in a moment and lasts for life. She has of course
never loved papa; then they would not be so matter-of-fact now."</p>

<p>"And what did you answer?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>Arla turned away. "I answered nothing," she said in a low voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5169" id="Page_5169">[Pg 5169]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother's troubled face grew a little brighter.</p>

<p>"That was right," she said, patting her on the cheek. "Then you left
him at once."</p>

<p>Arla was on the point of saying, "Not at once," but she could not make
this confession. Other questions would then follow, and she would be
obliged to describe what had happened. Describe a scene like this to
her mother, who did not know what love was! That was impossible! So
she said yes, but in so weak and troubled a voice that her mother at
once saw it was not true. This was not Arla's first untruth; on the
contrary, she had often been guilty of this fault when a child. She
was so shy and loving that she could not stand the smallest reproach,
and a severe look was enough to make her cry; consequently she was
always ready to deny as soon as she had made the slightest mistake.
But when her mother took her face between her hands and looked
straight into her eyes, she saw at once how matters stood, for the
eyes could hide nothing. And since Arla grew older she had fought so
much against this weakness that she had almost exaggerated her
truthfulness. She was now as quick to confess what might bring
displeasure on herself, as if she were afraid of giving temptation the
slightest room.</p>

<p>The mother, who with deep joy had noticed her many little victories
over herself, was painfully impressed by this relapse. She could not
now treat Arla as she had done when she was a little girl. Instead of
this, she opened the Bible by one of the many book-marks, with a
somewhat trembling hand.</p>

<p>"Although it is late, shall we not read a chapter together, as we
always do before we go to bed?" she asked, and looked up at her
daughter.</p>

<p>Arla stepped back, and cast an almost frightened glance at the little
footstool where she had been sitting at her mother's knee every
evening since she was a little girl. All this seemed now so
strange&mdash;it was no longer herself, it was a little younger sister, who
used to sit there and confess to her mother all her dreams and all her
little sorrows.</p>

<p>"I don't want to&mdash;I cannot read to-night."</p>

<p>Her mother laid the book down again, gave her daughter a mild, sad
look and said, "Then remember, my child, that this was the consequence
of your first ball."</p>

<p>Arla bent her head and left the room slowly. Her mother let her go;
she found it wisest to leave her to herself until her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5170" id="Page_5170">[Pg 5170]</a></span> emotion had
somewhat worn itself out. Aria would not go into her own room; she
dreaded Gurli's chatter; she had to be alone to get control over her
thoughts. In the drawing-room she found her father.</p>

<p>"Is mamma in her room?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is she alone? Are the children asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma is alone."</p>

<p>"Well! Good-night, my girl." He kissed her lips and went into the
bedroom.</p>

<p>Arla opened a window in the drawing-room to let out the hot air, and
then began to walk up and down wrapped in a large shawl, enjoying the
clear cold winter moonlight, which played over the snow and hid itself
behind the trees in the park outside the window. There they were to
meet to-morrow! Oh, if only he had said now, at once! If only she
could slip out now in her thin gown, and he could wrap his cape around
her to keep her warm&mdash;she did not remember that the men of to-day did
not wear capes like Romeo&mdash;and if then they could have gone away
together&mdash;far, far away from this prosaic world, where nobody
understood that two hearts could meet and find each other from the
first moment.</p>

<p>She was not left alone long; a door was opened, light steps came
tripping, and a white apparition in night-gown stood in the full light
of the moonbeam.</p>

<p>"But Arla, are you never, never coming?"</p>

<p>"Why, Gurli dear, why aren't you asleep long ago?"</p>

<p>"Eh? do you think I can sleep before I have heard something about the
ball? Come in now; how cold it is here!"</p>

<p>She was so cold that she shivered in her thin night-gown, but clung
nevertheless to her sister, who was standing by the window.</p>

<p>"Go; you are catching cold."</p>

<p>"I don't care," she said, chattering. "I am not going till you come."</p>

<p>Arla was, as usual, obliged to give in to the younger sister's strong
will. She closed the window and they went into their room, where Gurli
crept into bed again and drew the cover up to her very chin. Arla
began to unfasten her dress and take the flowers out of her hair.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you had a divine time," came a voice from the bed
behind chattering teeth. There was nothing to be seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5171" id="Page_5171">[Pg 5171]</a></span> out on the
floor. "Then you are much more of a schoolgirl than I. Is there
perhaps any man who has told you that he loves you? Is there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but Gurli, what nonsense," said Arla laughing outright. "Has
really one of Arvid's friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arvid's friends!" repeated Gurli with an expression of indescribable
contempt. "Do you think such little boys would dare? Ph! I would give
them a box on the ear,&mdash;that would be the quickest way of getting rid
of such little whipper-snappers. No indeed; it is a man, a real
<i>man</i>&mdash;a man that any girl would envy me."</p>

<p>She was so pretty as she stood there in her white gown, with her
dancing eyes and thick hair standing like a dark cloud around her rosy
young face, that a light broke on Arla, and a suspicion of the truth
flashed through her mind.</p>

<p>"It is not possible that you mean&mdash;of course you don't mean&mdash;him&mdash;that
you just spoke of&mdash;Captain Lagerski&ouml;ld?"</p>

<p>"And what if it <i>were</i> he!" cried Gurli, who in her triumph forgot to
keep her secret. Arla's usual modest self-possession left her
completely at this news.</p>

<p>"Captain Lagerski&ouml;ld has told you that he loves you!" she cried with a
sharp and cutting voice, unlike her usual mild tone. "Oh, how wicked,
how wicked!"</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands and burst out crying.</p>

<p>Gurli was frightened at her violent outbreak. She must have done
something awful, that Arla, who was always so quiet, should carry on
so. She crept close up to her sister, half ashamed and half
frightened, and whispered:&mdash;"He has only said it once. It was the day
before yesterday, and I ran away from him at once&mdash;I thought it was so
silly, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday!" cried Arla and looked up with frightened,
wondering eyes. "Day before yesterday he told you that he loved you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if only you will not be so awfully put out, I will tell you all
about it. He used to come up to the coasting-hill a great deal lately,
and then we walked up and down in the park and talked, and when I
wanted to coast he helped me get a start, and drew my sleigh up-hill
again. At first I did not notice him much, but then I saw he was very
nice&mdash;he would look at me sometimes for a long, long time&mdash;and you
can't imagine how he does look at one! And then day before yesterday
he began by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5172" id="Page_5172">[Pg 5172]</a></span> of Gurli but a pair of impatient dark eyes, under a
wilderness of brown hair.</p>

<p>Arla was sitting at the toilet-table, her back to her sister.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she said.</p>

<p>"I see on your card that you danced two dances with Captain
Lagerski&ouml;ld. I suppose he dances awfully well, eh?"</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" asked Arla, and turned on the chair.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I do. Didn't he ask for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now I remember. He said he had seen you with the children on the
coasting-hill. You must have been a little rude to him?"</p>

<p>The whole head came out above the cover now.</p>

<p>"Rude! how?"</p>

<p>"He said something about your being so pert."</p>

<p>"Pert? Oh, <i>what</i> a fib you do tell!" cried Gurli, and sat up in bed
with a jump.</p>

<p>"I don't usually tell stories," said Arla with wounded dignity, but
blushed at the same time.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do now, I am sure you do. I don't believe you, if you
don't tell me word for word what he said. Who began talking of me? And
what did he say? And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"You had better tell me why you are so much interested in him," said
Arla in the somewhat superior tone of the elder sister.</p>

<p>"That is none of your business. I will tell you that I am no longer a
little girl, as you seem to think. And even though I am treated like a
child here at home, there are others who&mdash;who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you not a child?" said Arla. "You are not confirmed yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it? That 'confirmation' is only a ceremony, which I
submit to for mamma's sake. And don't imagine that it is confirmation
which makes women of us; no indeed, it is something else."</p>

<p>"What then?" asked Arla, much surprised.</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;it is&mdash;love," burst out Gurli, and hid her head under the
covers.</p>

<p>"Love! But Gurli, how you do talk! What do you know about that? You, a
little schoolgirl!"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'little schoolgirl'&mdash;that makes me furious," cried Gurli,
as she pushed the cover aside with both hands and jumped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5173" id="Page_5173">[Pg 5173]</a></span> saying that
I had such pretty eyes&mdash;and then he said that such a happy little
sunbeam as I could light up his whole life, and that if he could not
meet me, he would not know what to do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gurli!" cried Arla, and grasped her sister's arm violently. "Do you
love him?"</p>

<p>Gurli let her eyes wander a little, and looked shy.</p>

<p>"I think I do&mdash;I have read in the novels Arvid borrowed in
school&mdash;only don't tell mamma anything about it; but I have read that
when you are in love you always have such an awful palpitation of the
heart when <i>he</i> comes&mdash;and when I merely catch sight of him far off on
the hill in Kommand&ouml;rsgatan, I felt as if I should strangle."</p>

<p>"Captain Lagerski&ouml;ld is a bad, bad man!" sobbed Arla, and rushed out
of the room, hiding her face in her hands.</p>

<p>The counselor's wife was still up and was reading, while her husband
had gone to bed. A tall screen standing at the foot of the bed kept
the light away from the sleeper. The counselor had just had a talk
with his wife, which most likely would keep her awake for the greater
part of the night; but he had fallen asleep as soon as he had spoken
to the point.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me that I cannot quite approve your way of
fulfilling your duties as hostess," he had said when he came in to
her.</p>

<p>His wife crossed her hands on the table and looked up at him with a
mild and patient face.</p>

<p>"You show your likes and dislikes too much," he continued, "and think
too little of the claims of social usage. For instance, to pay so much
attention to Mrs. Ekstr&ouml;m and her daughters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was because nobody else paid any attention to them."</p>

<p>"But even so, my dear, a drawing-room is not a charity institution, I
take it. Etiquette goes before everything else. And then you were
almost rude to Admiral Hornfeldt's wife, who is one of the first women
in society."</p>

<p>"Forgive me; but I cannot be cordial to a woman for whom I have no
respect."</p>

<p>The counselor shrugged his shoulders with a gesture of great
impatience.</p>

<p>"I wish you could learn to see how wrong it is to let yourself be
influenced by these moral views in society."</p>

<p>His wife was silent; it was her usual way of ending a conversation
which she knew could lead to no result, since each kept his own
opinion after all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5174" id="Page_5174">[Pg 5174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you notice Arla?" asked the counselor.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Did you not see that she made herself conspicuous by taking such an
interest in this outlived Lagerski&ouml;ld?"</p>

<p>"I asked you not to invite Captain Lagerski&ouml;ld," said his wife mildly.</p>

<p>"The trouble is not there," interrupted her husband; "but the trouble
is that your daughter is brought up to be a goose who understands
nothing. That is the result of your convent system. Girls so guarded
are always ready to fall into the arms of the first man who knows
somewhat how to impress them."</p>

<p>This was the counselor's last remark before he fell asleep. It
awakened a feeling of great bitterness and hopelessness in his wife.
Her heart felt heavy at the thought of all the frivolity, all the
impurity into which her girls were to be thrown one after another.
When Arla, in whose earnestness and purity of character she had so
great a confidence, had shown herself so little proof against
temptation, what then would become of Gurli, who had such dangerous
tendencies? And the two little ones who were now sleeping soundly in
the nursery?</p>

<p>"To what use is then all the striving and all the prayers?" she asked
herself. "What good then does it do to try to protect the children
from evil, if just this makes them more of a prey to temptation?"</p>

<p>She laid her arms on the table and rested her forehead on her hands.
The awful question "What is the use of it? what is the use of it?" lay
heavy upon her.</p>

<p>Then there came a soft knock at her door; it was opened a little, and
a timid voice whispered, "Is mamma alone? May I come in?"</p>

<p>A ray of happiness came into the mother's face.</p>

<p>"Come in, my child," she whispered, and stretched out her hands toward
her. "Papa sleeps so soundly, you need not be afraid of waking him."</p>

<p>Arla came in on tiptoe, dressed in white gown and dressing-sack and
with her hair loose. There were red spots on her cheeks, and her eyes
were swollen from crying. She knelt down gently beside her mother, hid
her face in her mother's dress, and whispered in a voice trembling
with suppressed tears, "Will you read to me now, mamma?"</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">robably for most persons the influence of Edwards will longest
survive through his wonderful personality. "From the days of Plato,"
says a writer in the Westminster Review, "there has been no life of
more simple and imposing grandeur." There are four memoirs. The
earliest is from Samuel Hopkins, D.D., a pupil and intimate friend. It
"has the quaint charm of Walton's Lives." The second, by Sereno
Edwards Dwight, D. D., is much more complete. He first brought to
light the remarkable early papers on topics in physics, natural
history, and philosophy. Dr. Samuel Miller's, in Sparks's 'Library of
American Biography,' is mainly a brief compend. The latest Life is by
Professor Alexander V. E. Allen, D. D. It endeavors to show "what he
[Edwards] thought, and how he came to think as he did," and is an
interesting and important contribution to a critical study of his
works. There is still need of an adequate biography, which can only be
written in connection with a thorough study of the manuscripts. A more
full and critical edition of Edwards's writings is also much to be
desired.</p>

<p>Edwards's first publication (1731) was a sermon preached in Boston
on 'God Glorified in Man's Dependence.' The conditions under which
it was produced afford striking contrasts to those attendant upon
Schleiermacher's epoch-making 'Reden &uuml;ber Religion'; but the same
note of absolute dependence upon God is struck by each with masterly
power. A yet more characteristic and deeply spiritual utterance
was given in the next published discourse, entitled 'A Divine
and Supernatural Light Immediately Imparted to the Soul by the
Spirit of God, Shown to be both a Scriptural and Rational Doctrine'
(1734). These two sermons are of primary significance for a right
understanding of their author's teaching. All is of God; faith is
sensibleness of what is real in the work of redemption; this reality
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5176" id="Page_5176">[Pg 5176]</a></span>is divinely and transcendently excellent; this quality of it is revealed
to the soul by the Holy Spirit, and becomes the spring of all holiness.
"The central idea of his system," says Henry B. Smith, "is
that of spiritual life (holy love) as the gift of divine grace." All of
Edwards's other writings may be arranged in relation to this principle,&mdash;as
introductory, explicative, or defensive.</p>

<p>When the sermon on the 'Reality of Spiritual Light' was delivered,
the movement had begun which, as afterwards extended from Northampton
to many communities in New England and beyond, is known
as "The Great Awakening." The preaching of Edwards was a prominent
instrumentality in its origination, and he became its most effective
promoter and champion, and no less its watchful observer and
critic. Among the published (1738) sermons which it occasioned
should be specially mentioned those on 'Justification by Faith Alone,'
'The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners,' 'The Excellency
of Jesus Christ,' 'The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit
of God, applied to that uncommon operation that has lately appeared
on the minds of many of the people of New England: with a particular
consideration of the extraordinary circumstances with which this
work is attended' (1741). The same year (1741) appeared the sermon
on 'Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God.' Some five years previous,
moved by the notice taken in London by Dr. Watts and Dr.
Guise of the religious revival in Northampton and several other
towns, and by a special request from Rev. Dr. Colman of Boston,
Edwards prepared a careful 'Narrative,' which, with a preface by
the English clergymen just named, was published in London in 1737,
and the year following in Boston. The sermon on the 'Distinguishing
Marks of a Work of the True Spirit of God' was followed by the
treatise entitled 'Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival of
Religion, and the way in which it ought to be acknowledged and promoted'
(1742); and four years later, by the elaborate work on 'Religious
Affections.' The latter sums up all that Edwards had learned,
through his participation in the movement whose beginnings and
early stages are described in the 'Narrative,' and by his long-continued
and most earnest endeavor to determine the true hopes of the
spiritual life which had enlisted and well-nigh absorbed all the powers
of his mind and soul. It is a religious classic of the highest
order, yet, like the 'De Imitatione Christi,' suited only to those who
can read it with independent insight. They who can thus use it will
find it inexhaustible in its strenuous discipline and spiritual richness,
light, and sweetness. Its chief defect lies in its failure to discover
and unfold the true relation between the natural and the spiritual,
and to recognize the stages of Christian growth, the genuineness and
value of what is still "imperfect Christianity."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5177" id="Page_5177">[Pg 5177]</a></span></p>
<p>The "revival," with the endeavor to discover and apply the tests of a
true Christian life, brought into prominence as a practical issue the
old question of the proper requirements for church membership. The
common practice failed to emphasize the necessity of spiritual
regeneration and conversion, as upheld by Edwards and his followers.
The controversy became acute at Northampton, and combined with other
issues, resulted in his dismissal from his pastorate. His meek yet
lofty bearing during this season of partisan strife and bitter
animosity has commanded general admiration. Before he closed the
contest he published two works which, in the Congregational churches,
settled the question at issue in accordance with his principles&mdash;viz.,
'An Humble Inquiry into the Rules of the Word of God concerning the
Qualifications requisite to a Complete Standing and Full Communion in
the Visible Christian Church,' and 'Misrepresentations Corrected and
Truth Vindicated in a Reply to the Rev. Solomon Williams's Book,' etc.</p>

<p>The reply to Williams was written and published after Edwards's
removal to Stockbridge. The period of his residence there (1751-1758,
January) was far from tranquil. His conscientious resistance to
schemes of pecuniary profit in the management of the Indian Mission
there, brought upon him bitter opposition. For six months he was
severely ill. In the French and Indian war a frontier town like
Stockbridge was peculiarly exposed to alarm and danger. Yet at this
time Edwards prepared the treatises on the 'Freedom of the Will,' the
'Ultimate End of Creation,' the 'Nature of Virtue,' and 'Original
Sin.' The first was published in 1754, the others after his death
(1758), as were many of his sermons, the 'History of Redemption,' and
extracts from his note-book ('Miscellaneous Observations,'
'Miscellaneous Remarks'). Early in 1758, having accepted the
presidency of the College of New Jersey, he removed to Princeton,
where he died March 22d.</p>

<p>That with enfeebled health, and under the conditions of his life at
Stockbridge, he should have prepared such works as those just
enumerated, is a striking evidence of his intellectual discipline and
power. It would probably have been impossible even for him, but for
the practice he had observed from youth of committing his thoughts to
writing, and their concentration on the subjects handled in these
treatises. A careful study of his manuscript notes would probably be
of service for new and critical editions, and would seem to be
especially appropriate, since only the work on the 'Freedom of the
Will' was published by its author.</p>

<p>It is impossible in the space of this sketch to analyze these
elaborate treatises, or to attempt a critical estimate of their value.
Foregoing this endeavor, I will simply add a few suggestions
occasioned <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5178" id="Page_5178">[Pg 5178]</a></span>principally by some recent studies, either of the
originals or copies of unpublished manuscripts.</p>

<p>Edwards's published works consist of compositions prepared with
reference to some immediate practical aim. When called to Princeton he
hesitated to accept, lest he should be interrupted in the preparation
of "a body of divinity in an entire new method, being thrown into the
form of a history." It was on his "mind and heart," "long ago begun,"
"a great work." The beginnings of it are preserved in the 'History of
Redemption' posthumously published, but this was written as early as
1739, as a series of sermons, and without thought of publication. The
volume of miscellanies, also published after his death, are extracts
from his note-book, arranged by the editor. Nowhere has Edwards
himself given a systematic exposition of his conception of
Christianity. The incompleteness of even the fullest edition of his
works increases the liability of misconstruction. It would not be
suspected, for instance, to what extent his mind dealt with the
conception of God as triune, or with the Incarnation.</p>

<p>His published works show on their face his relation to the religious
questions uppermost in men's minds during his lifetime. "He that would
know," writes Mr. Bancroft, "the workings of the New England mind in
the middle of the last century and the throbbings of its heart, must
give his days and nights to the study of Jonathan Edwards." And
Professor Allen justly adds, "He that would understand ... the
significance of later New England thought, must make Edwards the first
object of his study." Besides these high claims to attention, one more
may be made. The greatness of Edwards's character implies a contact of
his mind with permanent and the highest truth&mdash;a profound knowledge
and consciousness of God. Human and therefore imperfect, colored by
inherited prepossessions, and run into some perishable molds, his
thought is pervaded by a spiritual insight which has an original and
undying worth. It is not unlikely that the future will assign him a
higher rank than the past.</p>

<p>In one of the earliest, if not the first of his private philosophical
papers, the essay entitled 'Of Being,' may be found the key to his
fundamental conceptions. An exposition of his system, wrought out from
this point of view, will show that he has a secure and eminent
position among those who have contributed to that spiritual
apprehension of nature and man, of matter and mind, of the universe
and God, which has ever marked the thinking and influence of the
finest spirits and highest teachers of our race.</p>

<p>Edwards was born October 5th, 1703, in East Windsor, Connecticut. He
was the son of Rev. Timothy and Esther Stoddard Edwards; was graduated
at Yale College in 1720; studied theology at New Haven; from August
1722 to March 1723 preached in New York; from 1724 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5179" id="Page_5179">[Pg 5179]</a></span>to 1726 was a
tutor at Yale; on the 15th of February, 1727, was ordained at
Northampton, Massachusetts; in 1750 was dismissed from the church
there, and in 1751 removed to Stockbridge, Massachusetts. He was
called to Princeton in 1757, and died there March 22d, 1758.</p>

<h3><a name="REL_HISTORY" id="REL_HISTORY"></a>FROM NARRATIVE OF HIS RELIGIOUS HISTORY</h3>

<p>From about that time I began to have a new kind of apprehensions and
ideas of Christ, and the work of redemption, and the glorious way of
salvation by him. An inward sweet sense of these things at times came
into my heart, and my soul was led away in pleasant views and
contemplations of them. And my mind was greatly engaged to spend my
time in reading and meditating on Christ, on the beauty and excellency
of his person, and the lovely way of salvation by free grace in
him....</p>

<p>Not long after I first began to experience these things, I gave an
account to my father of some things that had passed in my mind. I was
pretty much affected by the discourse we had together; and when the
discourse was ended I walked abroad alone, in a solitary place in my
father's pasture, for contemplation. And as I was walking there and
looking upon the sky and clouds, there came into my mind so sweet a
sense of the glorious majesty and grace of God as I know not how to
express. I seemed to see them both in a sweet conjunction; majesty and
meekness joined together: it was a sweet, and gentle, and holy
majesty; and also a majestic meekness; an awful sweetness; a high, and
great, and holy gentleness.</p>

<p>After this my sense of divine things gradually increased, and became
more and more lively, and had more of that inward sweetness. The
appearance of everything was altered; there seemed to be, as it were,
a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine glory, in almost
everything. God's excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love, seemed
to appear in everything; in the sun, moon, and stars, in the clouds
and blue sky, in the grass, flowers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5180" id="Page_5180">[Pg 5180]</a></span> trees, in the water and all
nature; which used greatly to fix my mind. I often used to sit and
view the moon for a long time, and in the day spent much time in
viewing the clouds and sky, to behold the sweet glory of God in these
things; in the meantime singing forth, with a low voice, my
contemplations of the Creator and Redeemer. And scarce anything among
all the works of nature was so sweet to me as thunder and lightning;
formerly nothing had been so terrible to me. Before, I used to be
uncommonly terrified with thunder, and to be struck with terror when I
saw a thunder-storm rising; but now, on the contrary, it rejoiced me.
I felt God, if I may so speak, at the first appearance of a
thunder-storm; and used to take the opportunity at such times to fix
myself in order to view the clouds and see the lightnings play and
hear the majestic and awful voice of God's thunder, which oftentimes
was exceedingly entertaining, leading me to sweet contemplations of my
great and glorious God. While thus engaged it always seemed natural
for me to sing or chant forth my meditations, or to speak my thoughts
in soliloquies with a singing voice.</p>

<p>My sense of divine things seemed gradually to increase, till I went to
preach at New York, which was about a year and a half after they
began; and while I was there I felt them very sensibly, in a much
higher degree than I had done before. My longings after God and
holiness were much increased. . . .</p>

<p>Holiness, as I then wrote down some of my contemplations on it,
appeared to me to be of a sweet, pleasant, charming, serene, calm
nature, which brought an inexpressible purity, brightness,
peacefulness, and ravishment to the soul. In other words, that it made
the soul like a field or garden of God, with all manner of pleasant
flowers; enjoying a sweet calm and the gently vivifying beams of the
sun. The soul of a true Christian, as I then wrote my meditations,
appeared like such a little white flower as we see in the spring of
the year; low and humble on the ground, opening its bosom to receive
the pleasant beams of the sun's glory; rejoicing as it were in a calm
rapture; diffusing around a sweet fragrancy; standing peacefully and
lovingly in the midst of other flowers round about; all in like manner
opening their bosoms, to drink in the light of the sun. There was no
part of creature-holiness, that I had so great a sense of its
loveliness, as humility, brokenness of heart, and poverty of spirit;
and there was nothing that I so earnestly longed for. My heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5181" id="Page_5181">[Pg 5181]</a></span> panted
after this&mdash;to lie low before God, as in the dust; that I might be
nothing, and that God might be All; that I might become as a little
child.</p>


<h4>RESOLUTIONS</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Resolved, Never to do any manner of thing, whether in soul or
body, less or more, but what tends to the glory of God; nor be nor
suffer it, if I can possibly avoid it."</p>

<p>"Resolved, To live with all my might while I do live."</p>

<p>"Resolved, When I think of any theorem in divinity to be solved,
immediately to do what I can towards solving it, if circumstances do
not hinder."</p>

<p>"Resolved, To endeavor to my utmost to deny whatever is not
most agreeable to a good and universally sweet and benevolent,
quiet, peaceable, contented and easy, compassionate and generous,
humble and meek, submissive and obliging, diligent and industrious,
charitable and even, patient, moderate, forgiving and sincere temper;
and to do at all times what such a temper would lead me to; and
to examine strictly, at the end of every week, whether I have so
done."</p>

<p>"On the supposition that there was never to be but one individual
in the world, at any one time, who was properly a complete
Christian, in all respects of a right stamp, having Christianity always
shining in its true lustre, and appearing excellent and lovely, from
whatever part and under whatever character viewed: Resolved, To
act just as I would do, if I strive with all my might to be that one,
who should live in my time."</p>

<p>"I observe that old men seldom have any advantage of new discoveries,
because they are beside the way of thinking to which they
have been so long used: Resolved, If ever I live to years, that I
will be impartial to hear the reasons of all pretended discoveries, and
receive them if rational, how long soever I have been used to another
way of thinking. My time is so short that I have not time to perfect,
myself in all studies: Wherefore resolved, to omit and put off
all but the most important and needful studies."</p></div>

<h3><a name="LEAF" id="LEAF"></a>WRITTEN ON A BLANK LEAF IN 1723</h3>

<p>They say there is a young lady [in New Haven] who is beloved of that
Great Being who made and rules the world, and that there are certain
seasons in which this Great Being, in some way or other invisible,
comes to her and fills her mind with exceeding sweet delight, and that
she hardly cares for anything except to meditate on him&mdash;that she
expects after a while to be received up where he is, to be raised up
out of the world and caught up into heaven; being assured that he
loves her too well to let her remain at a distance from him always.
There she is to dwell with him, and to be ravished with his love and
delight forever. Therefore, if you present all the world before her,
with the richest of its treasures, she disregards it and cares not for
it, and is unmindful of any pain or affliction. She has a strange
sweetness in her mind, and singular purity in her affections; is most
just and conscientious in all her conduct; and you could not persuade
her to do anything wrong or sinful, if you would give her all the
world, lest she should offend this Great Being. She is of a wonderful
sweetness, calmness, and universal benevolence of mind; especially
after this great God has manifested himself to her mind. She will
sometimes go about from place to place, singing sweetly; and seems to
be always full of joy and pleasure; and no one knows for what. She
loves to be alone, walking in the fields and groves, and seems to have
some one invisible always conversing with her.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="NOTHING" id="NOTHING"></a>THE IDEA OF NOTHING</h3>

<h4>From 'Of Being'</h4>

<p>A state of absolute nothing is a state of absolute contradiction.
Absolute nothing is the aggregate of all the absurd contradictions in
the world; a state wherein there is neither body nor spirit, nor
space, neither empty space nor full space, neither little nor great,
narrow nor broad, neither infinitely great space nor finite space, nor
a mathematical point, neither up nor down, neither north nor south (I
do not mean as it is with respect to the body of the earth or some
other great body, but no contrary point nor positions or directions),
no such thing as either here or there, this way or that way, or only
one way. When we go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5183" id="Page_5183">[Pg 5183]</a></span> about to form an idea of perfect nothing we must
shut out all these things; we must shut out of our minds both space
that has something in it, and space that has nothing in it. We must
not allow ourselves to think of the least part of space, never so
small. Nor must we suffer our thoughts to take sanctuary in a
mathematical point. When we go to expel body out of our thoughts, we
must cease not to leave empty space in the room of it; and when we go
to expel emptiness from our thoughts, we must not think to squeeze it
out by anything close, hard, and solid, but we must think of the same
that the sleeping rocks dream of; and not till then shall we get a
complete idea of nothing.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="FREEWILL" id="FREEWILL"></a>THE NOTION OF ACTION AND AGENCY ENTERTAINED BY MR. CHUBB AND OTHERS</h3>
<h4>From the 'Inquiry into the Freedom of the Will,' Part iv., &sect; 2</h4>

<p>So that according to their notion of the act, considered with
regard to its consequences, these following things are all
essential to it: viz., That it should be necessary, and not
necessary; that it should be from a cause, and no cause; that it
should be the fruit of choice and design, and not the fruit of
choice and design; that it should be the beginning of motion or
exertion, and yet consequent on previous exertion; that it should
be before it is; that it should spring immediately out of indifference
and equilibrium, and yet be the effect of preponderation;
that it should be self-originated, and also have its original from
something else; that it is what the mind causes itself, of its own
will, and can produce or prevent according to its choice or pleasure,
and yet what the mind has no power to prevent, precluding
all previous choice in the affair.</p>

<p>So that an act, according to their metaphysical notion of it, is
something of which there is no idea.... If some learned
philosopher who had been abroad, in giving an account of the
curious observations he had made in his travels, should say he
had been in Tierra del Fuego, and there had seen an animal,
which he calls by a certain name, that begat and brought forth
itself, and yet had a sire and dam distinct from itself; that it had
an appetite and was hungry, before it had a being; that his master,
who led him and governed him at his pleasure, was always
governed by him and driven by him where he pleased; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5184" id="Page_5184">[Pg 5184]</a></span>
when he moved he always took a step before the first step; that
he went with his head first, and yet always went tail foremost;
and this though he had neither head nor tail: it would be no
impudence at all to tell such a traveler, though a learned man,
that he himself had no idea of such an animal as he gave an
account of, and never had, nor ever would have.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CHRIST" id="CHRIST"></a>EXCELLENCY OF CHRIST</h3>

<p>When we behold a beautiful body, a lovely proportion and beautiful
harmony of features, delightful airs of countenance and voice, and
sweet motions and gestures, we are charmed with it, not under the
notion of a corporeal but a mental beauty. For if there could be a
statue that should have exactly the same, that could be made to have
the same sounds and the same motions precisely, we should not be so
delighted with it, we should not fall entirely in love with the image,
if we knew certainly that it had no perception or understanding. The
reason is, we are apt to look upon this agreeableness, those airs, to
be emanations of perfections of the mind, and immediate effects of
internal purity and sweetness. Especially it is so when we love the
person for the airs of voice, countenance, and gesture, which have
much greater power upon us than barely colors and proportion of
dimensions. And it is certainly because there is an analogy between
such a countenance and such airs and those excellencies of the
mind,&mdash;a sort of I know not what in them that is agreeable, and does
consent with such mental perfections; so that we cannot think of such
habitudes of mind without having an idea of them at the same time. Nor
can it be only from custom; for the same dispositions and actings of
mind naturally beget such kind of airs of countenance and gesture,
otherwise they never would have come into custom. I speak not here of
the ceremonies of conversation and behavior, but of those simple and
natural motions and airs. So it appears, because the same habitudes
and actings of mind do beget [airs and movements] in general the same
amongst all nations, in all ages.</p>

<p>And there is really likewise an analogy or consent between the beauty
of the skies, trees, fields, flowers, etc., and spiritual
excellencies, though the agreement be more hid, and require a more
discerning, feeling mind to perceive it than the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5185" id="Page_5185">[Pg 5185]</a></span> Those have
their airs, too, as well as the body and countenance of man, which
have a strange kind of agreement with such mental beauties. This makes
it natural in such frames of mind to think of them and fancy ourselves
in the midst of them. Thus there seem to be love and complacency in
flowers and bespangled meadows; this makes lovers so much delight in
them. So there is a rejoicing in the green trees and fields, and
majesty in thunder beyond all other noises whatever.</p>

<p>Now, we have shown that the Son of God created the world for this very
end, to communicate himself in an image of his own excellency. He
communicates himself, properly, only to spirits; and they only are
capable of being proper images of his excellency, for they only are
properly <i>beings</i>, as we have shown. Yet he communicates a sort of a
shadow, a glimpse, of his excellencies to bodies, which, as we have
shown, are but the shadows of beings, and not real beings. He who by
his immediate influence gives being every moment, and by his spirit
actuates the world, because he inclines to communicate himself and his
excellencies, doth doubtless communicate his excellency to bodies, as
far as there is any consent or analogy. And the beauty of face and
sweet airs in men are not always the effect of the corresponding
excellencies of mind; yet the beauties of nature are really emanations
or shadows of the excellencies of the Son of God.</p>

<p>So that when we are delighted with flowery meadows and gentle breezes
of wind, we may consider that we see only the emanations of the sweet
benevolence of Jesus Christ. When we behold the fragrant rose and
lily, we see this love and purity. So the green trees, and fields, and
singing of birds are the emanations of his infinite joy and benignity.
The easiness and naturalness of trees and vines are shadows of his
beauty and loveliness. The crystal rivers and murmuring streams are
the footsteps of his favor, grace, and beauty. When we behold the
light and brightness of the sun, the golden edges of an evening cloud,
or the beauteous bow, we behold the adumbrations of his glory and
goodness; and in the blue sky, of his mildness and gentleness. There
are also many things wherein we may behold his awful majesty: in the
sun in his strength, in comets, in thunder, in the hovering
thunder-clouds, in ragged rocks and the brows of mountains. That
beauteous light with which the world is filled in a clear day is a
lively shadow of his spotless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5186" id="Page_5186">[Pg 5186]</a></span> holiness, and happiness, and delight,
in communicating himself; and doubtless this is a reason that Christ
is so often compared to those things and called by their names,&mdash;as,
the Sun of Righteousness, the Morning Star, the Rose of Sharon, the
Lily of the Valley, the apple-tree amongst the trees of the wood, a
bundle of myrrh, a roe, or a young hart. By this we may discover the
beauty of many of those metaphors and similes which to an
unphilosophical person do seem so uncouth.</p>

<p>In like manner, when we behold the beauty of man's body in its
perfection we still see like emanations of Christ's divine
perfections; although they do not always flow from the mental
excellencies of the person that has them. But we see far the most
proper image of the beauty of Christ when we see beauty in the human
soul.</p>

<p>Corol. I. From hence it is evident that man is in a fallen state; and
that he has naturally scarcely anything of those sweet graces which
are an image of those which are in Christ. For no doubt, seeing that
other creatures have an image of them according to their capacity, so
all the rational and intelligent part of the world once had according
to theirs.</p>

<p>Corol. II. There will be a future state wherein man will have them
according to his capacity. How great a happiness will it be in Heaven
for the saints to enjoy the society of each other, since one may see
so much of the loveliness of Christ in those things which are only
shadows of beings. With what joy are philosophers filled in beholding
the aspectable world. How sweet will it be to behold the proper image
and communications of Christ's excellency in intelligent beings,
having so much of the beauty of Christ upon them as Christians shall
have in heaven. What beautiful and fragrant flowers will those be,
reflecting all the sweetnesses of the Son of God! How will Christ
delight to walk in this garden among those beds of spices, to feed in
the gardens, and to gather lilies!</p>

<h3><a name="THE_ESSENCE_OF_TRUE_VIRTUE" id="THE_ESSENCE_OF_TRUE_VIRTUE"></a>THE ESSENCE OF TRUE VIRTUE</h3>

<h4>From 'The Nature of True Virtue,' Chapters i, ii</h4>

<p>True virtue most essentially consists in benevolence to being
in general. Or perhaps, to speak more accurately, it is that
consent, propensity, and union of heart to being in general,
which is immediately exercised in a general good-will....</p>

<p>A benevolent propensity of heart to being in general, and a
temper or disposition to love God supremely, are in effect the
same thing.... However, every particular exercise of love
to a creature may not <i>sensibly</i> arise from any exercise of love to
God, or an explicit consideration of any similitude, conformity,
union or relation to God, in the creature beloved.</p>

<p>The most proper evidence of love to a created being arising
from that temper of mind wherein consists a supreme propensity
of heart to God, seems to be the agreeableness of the kind and
degree of our love to God's end in our creation, and in the creation
of all things, and the coincidence of the exercises of our
love, in their manner, order, and measure, with the manner in
which God himself exercises love to the creature in the creation
and government of the world, and the way in which God, as the
first cause and supreme disposer of all things, has respect to the
creature's happiness in subordination to himself as his own supreme
end. For the true virtue of created beings is doubtless their
highest excellency and their true goodness.... But the true
goodness of a thing must be its agreeableness to its end, or its
fitness to answer the design for which it was made. Therefore
they are good moral agents whose temper of mind or propensity
of heart is agreeable to the end for which God made moral
agents....</p>

<p>A truly virtuous mind ... above all things seeks the glory
of God.... This consists in the expression of God's perfections
in their proper effects,&mdash;the manifestation of God's glory to
created understandings; the communication of the infinite fullness
of God to the creature; the creature's highest esteem of God,
love to and joy in him; and in the proper exercises and expressions
of these. And so far as virtuous mind exercises true virtue
in benevolence to created beings, it chiefly seeks the good of the
creature; consisting in its knowledge or view of God's glory and
beauty, its union with God, uniformity and love to him, and joy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5188" id="Page_5188">[Pg 5188]</a></span>
in him. And that disposition of heart, that consent, union, or
propensity of mind to being in general which appears chiefly in
such exercises, is virtue, truly so called; or in other words, true
grace and real holiness. And no other disposition or affection
but this is of the nature of virtue.</p>

<h2><a name="GERORGES_EEKHOUD" id="GERORGES_EEKHOUD"></a>GERORGES EEKHOUD</h2>

<h4>(1854-)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capl.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="L" title="L" />
</div><p class="dropcap">a Jeune Belgique" is more than a school; it is a literary movement,
which began about the year 1880. The aim of this group of writers is
to found a national literature, which uses the French language and
technique for the expression of the Flemish or Walloon spirit, and the
peculiar sentiment and individuality of the Belgian race which has
developed between the more powerful nations of France and Germany. In
the words of William Sharp:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To one who has closely studied the whole movement in its intimate and
extra-national bearings, as well as in its individual manifestations
and aberrations, its particular and collective achievement in the
several literary <i>genres</i>, there is no question as to the radical
distinction between Belgic and French literature. Whether there be a
great future for the first, is almost entirely dependent on the
concurrent political condition of Belgium. If Germany were to
appropriate the country, it is almost certain that only the Flemish
spirit would retain its independent vitality, and even that probably
only for a generation or two. But if Belgium were absorbed by France,
Brussels would almost immediately become as insignificant a literary
centre as is Lyons or Bordeaux, or be, at most, not more independent
of Paris than is Marseilles. Literary Belgium would be a memory,
within a year of the hoisting of the French tricolor from the Scheldt
to the Liege. Meanwhile, the whole energy of 'Young Belgium' is
consciously or unconsciously concentrated in the effort to withstand
Paris."</p></div>

<p>Among the leading spirits of "La Jeune Belgique" are Maurice
Maeterlinck, Georges Eekhoud, Camille Lemonnier, Georges Rodenbach,
J.K. Huysmans, Auguste Jenart, Eugene Demolder, and a number of
others, who have distinguished themselves in fiction and poetry. Their
works are generally inspired by the uncompromising sense of the
reality of ordinary life, which would sometimes be repulsive if it
were not for their brilliant style and psychological undercurrent.</p>

<p>This school of literature is somewhat analogous to that of the Flemish
painting. Nature is always an important accessory to the development
of the action; and therefore the landscapes and the <i>genre</i> pictures
are given with a rapid and sure touch and in a vivid and high key,&mdash;so
high that at times the colors are almost crude. The reader of these
Belgian writers often feels, in consequence, that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5190" id="Page_5190">[Pg 5190]</a></span>he is looking at a
series of paintings which are being explained by a narrator.</p>

<p>Of all these writers, Georges Eekhoud, whom Mr. Sharp calls "the
Maupassant of the Low Countries," is the one who has made the greatest
effort to model his work upon the style of the contemporary French
authors. He was born in Antwerp, May 27th 1854. His literary career
was begun as an editor of the Precursor, in Antwerp, but he soon
became associated with L'&Eacute;toile Beige as literary editor. In 1877 he
published his first volume, entitled 'Myrtes et Cypr&egrave;s.' This was
succeeded by a second book of poetry, 'Zigzags Poetiqu&eacute;s et
Pittoresques,' which appeared in 1879. Among the most admired of these
poems are 'La Mare aux Sangues,' 'Nina,' 'Raymonne,' and the strong
'La Guigne.'</p>

<p>French critics say that his diction lacks polish, but that he has
strength, color, and a talent for description. His novels are&mdash;'Kees
Doorik' (1884), 'Les Kermesses' (1884), 'Les Milices de
Saint-Frangois' (1886), 'Les Nouvelles Kermesses' (1887), and 'La
Nouvelle Carthage' (1888). The latter is considered his most brilliant
novel, and won for him the quinquennial prize of 5,000 francs given
for French literature in Belgium. It is a vivid picture of Antwerp,
with vigorous and highly colored descriptions of its middle-class
citizens, enriched by centuries of continued prosperity. In general,
Eekhoud is naturalistic, and intent only on painting life as he sees
and feels it. His other books include&mdash;'Cycle Patibulaire' (1892); 'Au
Siecle de Shakespeare,' a valuable book on the English literature of
the Elizabethan period (1893); and 'Mes Communions' (1895).</p>

<h3><a name="EXVOTO" id="EXVOTO"></a>EX-VOTO</h3>

<h4>From 'The Massacre of the Innocents, and Other Tales by Belgian Writers':
copyright 1895, by Stone &amp; Kimball</h4>

<p>The country I know and love best does not exist for the tourist,
and neither guide nor doctor ever dreams of recommending
it.  This reassures me, for I love my country selfishly,
exclusively.  The land is ancient, flat, the home of fogs. With
the exception of the Polder <i>schorres</i>, the district fertilized by the
overflowing of the river, few districts are cultivated.  A single
canal from the Scheldt irrigates its fields and plains, and occasional
railways connect its unfrequented towns.</p>

<p>The politician execrates it, the merchant despises it, it intimidates
and baffles legions of bad painters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5191" id="Page_5191">[Pg 5191]</a></span></p>

<p>Poets of the boudoir! virtuosi!  This flat country will always
elude your descriptions!  For you, landscape painters, there is no
inspiration to be gained here.  O chosen land, neither thou nor
thy secret can be seen at a glance!  The degenerate folk who
pass through this country feel nothing of its healthy, intoxicating
charm, or are only wearied in the midst of this gray peaceful
nature, unrelieved by hill or torrent; and still less sympathy have
they with the country louts who stare at them with placid bovine
eyes.</p>

<p>The people remain robust, uncouth, obstinate, and ignorant.
No music stirs me like the Flemish from their lips.  They mouth
it, drawl it, linger lovingly over the guttural syllables, while the
harsh consonants fall heavily as their fists.  They move slowly,
swingingly, bent-shouldered and heavy-jawed; like bulls, they are
at once fierce and taciturn.  Never shall I meet more comely, firm-bosomed
lassies, never see eyes more appealing, than those of this
dear land of mine.  Under their blue <i>kiel</i> the brawny lads swagger
well content; though when in drink, if dispute arises, rivalry
may drive them into fatal conflicts.  The <i>tierendar</i> ends many a
quarrel without further ado; and as the combatants cut and hack,
their faces preserve that dogged smile of the old Germans who
fought in the Roman arenas.  During the kermesses they over-eat
themselves, they get drunk, dance with a kind of <i>gauche</i> solemnity,
embrace their sweethearts without much ceremony, and when
the dance is over, gratify themselves with all manner of excesses.</p>

<p>One and all, they are slow to give themselves away; but once
gained, their affection is unalterable.</p>

<p>Those who depict them thick-set, laughter-loving, misshapen
boors, do not know this race.  The Campine peasantry recall
rather the brown shepherd folk of Jordaens than the pot-house
scenes by Teniers, a great man who slandered his Perck rustics.</p>

<p>They preserve the faith of past centuries, undertake pilgrim-ages,
respect their <i>pastoor</i>, believe in the Devil, in the wizard, in
the evil eye, that <i>jettatura</i> of the North.  So much the better.
These yokels fascinate me.  I prefer their poetic traditions, the
legends drawled out by an old <i>pachteresse</i> in the evening hours,
to the liveliest tale of Voltaire, and their clan-narrowness and
religious fanaticism stir me more than the patriotic declamations
and the insipid civic rhodomontade of the journalist.  Splendid
and glorious rebels, these Vendeans of ours; may philosophy and
civilization long forget them.  When the day of equality, dreamed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5192" id="Page_5192">[Pg 5192]</a></span>
of by geometric minds, comes, they will disappear also, my
superb brutes; hunted down, crushed by invasion, but to the end
unyielding to Positivist influences.  My brothers, utilitarianism
will do away with you, you and your rude remote country!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I who have your hot rebel blood coursing in my
veins, I who shall not survive you, am fain to steep my spirit in
yours, to be at one with you in all that is rude and savage in
you, to stupefy myself at great casks of brown ale at the fairs,
with you to raise up my voice when the clouds of incense rise
like smoke above your sacred processions, to seat myself in silence
beside your smoky hearths or to wander alone across the desolate
sand-dunes at the hour when the frogs croak, and when the distraught
shepherd, become an incendiary and a lost man, grazes his flock of
fire across the heaths....</p>

<p>At the beginning of the June of 1865, I had just reached my
eleventh birthday and made my first communion with the Fr&egrave;res
de la Misericorde at M&mdash;&mdash;.  One morning I was called into the
parlor; there I found the father superior and my uncle, who told
me that he would take me to Antwerp to see my father.  At the
idea of this unexpected holiday and the prospect of embracing
my kind parent, who had been a widower for five years and to
whom I was now everything, I did not notice my uncle's serious
looks nor the pitying glances of the monk.</p>

<p>We set off. The train did not go fast enough for my liking. However,
we arrived at last. To ring the door-bell of the simple little
house; to embrace Yana the servant; to submit to the caresses of good
Lion, a splendid brown spaniel, to race up-stairs with him four
steps at a time, to bound into the familiar bedroom, then two
words:&mdash;"Father!&mdash;George!"&mdash;to feel myself lifted up and pressed
against his heart; to be devoured with kisses, my lips seeking his in
the big fair beard: these actions followed one another rapidly; but
transient as they were, they are forever graven on my memory. What a
long time the dear man held me in his arms! He looked at me with
tender admiration, repeating, "What a big boy you have grown, my
Jurgen, my Krapouteki!" and he repeated a whole string of impossible
but adorable pet names he had invented for me, and among which he
interspersed caresses. It was still early in the morning.</p>

<p>When I entered, followed by Lion, Yana, and finally by my uncle, the
least member of the four, my father was in his dressing-gown, but was
about to dress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5193" id="Page_5193">[Pg 5193]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked splendid to me. His color was fresh, but too flushed about
the cheek-bones, I was told afterwards; his eyes sparkled&mdash;sparkled
too much; his voice was a little hoarse, but sweet, caressing, despite
its grave tone,&mdash;a tone never to be forgotten by me.</p>

<p>He was then forty-six. I see his tall figure rise before me now, with
his well-set limbs; and his kind face still smiles on me in my dreams.</p>

<p>My uncle clasped his hand.</p>

<p>"You see that I keep my word, Ferdinand. Here's the little scamp
himself!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Henry. Pardon the trouble I have caused you.... You will
laugh at me; but if you had not brought him, I should have gone to the
convent myself to-day.... I should have scorned the doctor's regime
and prescriptions.... You do not know, Georgie.... I have not been
very well.... Oh, a mere nothing; a small ailment, a neglected
cold.... A slight cold, was it not, Yana? ... I have lost it, as you
see.... Ah! my boy, what good it does me to see you! ... What fun we
shall have! We are going out into the country at once.... I have
prepared a surprise for you."</p>

<p>I listened enchanted&mdash;oh the selfishness of childhood! The promise of
this expedition made me deaf to his cough&mdash;a dry, convulsive cough
which he tried to stifle by holding his silk handkerchief to his
mouth. Neither did I notice&mdash;or rather I did notice but attached no
importance to&mdash;the bottles of medicine and pill-boxes which stood on
the chimney-piece and on the bed-table. A bottle of syrup had just
been opened, and a drop remained in the silver spoon. Yana held a
prescription in her hand, which had been written that morning. A heavy
odor of opiates and other drugs filled the room. These details only
recurred to me afterwards.</p>

<p>My uncle took leave.</p>

<p>"Above all, no imprudence!" he said to my father. "You promise me? Be
back in town before the dew falls.... I will take George to school
again to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Set your mind at rest; we will be wise!" replied my father, excited
and preoccupied, thinking only of his child.</p>

<p>I believe that he was not sorry to find himself alone with me, and as
the prospect of returning to M&mdash;&mdash;, evoked by the old officer, had
saddened me, he took me on his knee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5194" id="Page_5194">[Pg 5194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Courage! little one," he said. "It is not for long. I feel too lonely
since the death of your poor mother. I have told my family that in the
future I do not intend to be separated from you ... You have made your
first communion, ... you are big, ... you shall go back to school for
a week, just time to pack up and to settle in our new quarters....
Come, there, I am betraying the secret ... Never mind, after all, I
may as well tell you everything now. I have bought a pretty little
house, almost a farmstead, three miles from here.... We are going to
live in the country, like peasants, to wear sabots and smocks. Hey?
That will make you grow.... What do you say to it?... We shall be
always together."</p>

<p>I clapped my hands, and jumped round the room.</p>

<p>"What joy! Always we two, is that it? Then we shall be always
together. Is it really true?"</p>

<p>"Really true."</p>

<p>We sealed this understanding in a long embrace.</p>

<p>An hour later my father, Yana, and I stepped into a landau at the
door.</p>

<p>It was one of those enervating equinoctial days when the warmth and
the intense quietness affect one almost to tears. The sun, in a
beautiful Flemish sky of pale, soft turquoise, had dispersed the
morning mist.</p>

<p>"Look at him, sir," said Yana, pointing to me; "he is as happy as a
king!"</p>

<p>"Now is the time to take in a plentiful supply of air," remarked my
father; "one only needs to open one's mouth!"</p>

<p>I opened mine quite wide, as if I were yawning.</p>

<p>What a difference, too, between this air and the air at school; even
that which one breathed out of doors in the cloistered court, shut in
by four forbidding high walls, sweating with damp and decaying with
mildew.</p>

<p>Seated with my back to the coachman, my hands on my father's knee, I
uttered exclamations of surprise and besieged him with questions. He
sat back in the carriage, shielded from the wind by his big overcoat.
Yana sat beside him; Lion ran on in advance.</p>

<p>Passing along the chief street of the suburb, we came out into the
open country. The tufts of young leaves gave a sweet freshness to the
hoary trunks of the great beech-trees which lined the road. In place
of the yellow withered grass in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5195" id="Page_5195">[Pg 5195]</a></span> meadows, there was a vivid
emerald carpet; splendid cows, with well-rounded flanks and dewlaps
reaching the ground, nibbled the tender shoots. The full rows of young
corn promised a plentiful harvest. Between a double hedge of
weeping-willows and alders ran silvery waters, swollen by the melting
of the late snows. When we passed a flower-garden the scent of lilac
filled the dreamy air. Gates with gilt knobs opened on avenues of elms
and oaks; sloping lawns led up to a castle, whose terrace was
ornamented with clipped and modeled orange-trees. The majestic passing
of a pair of big swans or the scurry of hare-brained ducks stirred the
stagnant pond, and left wakes amid the flags and water-lilies.</p>

<p>Moss-grown farmsteads, flanked by barns with green shutters fixed to
the red bricks, draw-wells, chickens picking about on the
manure-heaps,&mdash;these were my chief delight. Sometimes a countryman's
cart with its white awning stood on one side for us to pass.</p>

<p>We drove through Deurne, then through Wyneghem.</p>

<p>For the third time a slender spire lifted its gray-slated point into
the opaline sky.</p>

<p>"S'Gravenwezel tower!" exclaimed Yana.</p>

<p>"S'Gravenwezel! But that is your village!" I cried. "Are we going to
live there?"</p>

<p>The good creature smiled in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Some few moments later, the driver, directed by Yana, stopped in front
of a lonely farm, a quarter of an hour away from the rest of the long,
straggling village.</p>

<p>"This is my parents' home!" she said.</p>

<p>I can still see the little one-storied farmhouse, with its overhanging
thatched roof, festooned with stone-crop, a white chalk cross on the
brickwork to protect it from lightning. At sound of the carriage, the
whole household ran to the door. There was Yana's father, a short,
thick-set sexagenarian, bent but still healthy-looking, his face
wrinkled like old parchment, with a stiff beard and bright eyes; the
mother, a buxom woman about ten years younger, very active despite her
stoutness; then a host of brothers and sisters, varying from
twenty-five to fifteen; the boys bold, dark, curly-headed, muscular,
square-set fellows; the girls fresh-looking, tanned by the sun, all
like Yana their elder sister, who, to my mind, was the most charming
<i>boerine annversoise</i> that one could imagine, with her dark hair, her
big emerald-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5196" id="Page_5196">[Pg 5196]</a></span>green eyes and sweeping lashes. In honor of S'Gravenwezel
kermesse,&mdash;sounds of which could already be heard in the distance,
&mdash;they said, but more in honor of our visit, the men wore their Sunday
trousers, and bright blue smocks coquettishly gathered at the neck.
The women had taken out their lace caps with big wings, the
head-dresses with silver pins, woolen dresses, and large silk
handkerchiefs which crossed over the breast and fell in a point
behind. The good people complimented my father on his appearance.
"That is Mynheer's son,&mdash;Jonkheer Jorss!" In a few moments I had made
friends with these simple cordial folk, and particularly with a fine
lad of nineteen&mdash;"onze Jan" (our Jean), said Yana&mdash;on the eve of
drawing lots for the conscription.</p>

<p>When his sister laid the table,&mdash;for we were to stay to dinner
there,&mdash;he offered to show me the orchard, the garden, and the
stables. I accepted joyfully. I could no longer keep still. Jean, with
my hand in his, took me first to the cows. As they lay down, chained
up in their sheds, they lowed piteously. The dung-strewn bedding shone
with bronze and old-gold, and the far end of the stable resembled a
picture by Rembrandt&mdash;at least, it is thus that I recall to-day that
reddish-brown half-light. That I might be better able to admire the
animals, he roused them with a kick. They got up lazily, sulkily. He
told me their names and their good points. That big black one, with
the spot between her eyes, was Lottek&egrave;; this big glutton chewing the
early clover was called La Blanche. Jan persuaded me to pat them. They
rubbed their horns against the posts which divided them. The boy told
me that they were excellent milkers. I counted six in all. A strong
smell of milk filled the air, warm with all this breathing, heaving
animality. Jan promised to take me to work in the fields with him when
I came to live in the village. I should dig the ground and become a
real peasant, a <i>boer</i> like himself. <i>Boer Jorss</i>, he called me,
laughing. But I took this prospect of country life quite seriously; I
admired the fine figure, the proud healthy bearing, of this young
peasant. I in my turn should grow like that, I thought. A career such
as his awaited me! That was better than wearing a frock-coat and a
black hat, than growing pale and fevered over books and copies, and
seeing nothing of beautiful nature except what can be found in a
suburb: weeds growing over waste places and patches of sky amid
spotted roofs!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5197" id="Page_5197">[Pg 5197]</a></span> He took me also to the garden, an oblong inclosure
with well-kept paths, and planted with sunflowers, peonies, and
hollyhocks. The beds were edged with strawberry plants, the fruit just
ripening. The kind lad promised me the first that were gathered.</p>

<p>We were called back to the house, while I was making the acquaintance
of Spits the watch-dog. The kermesse meal awaited us. At the express
request of my father, who threatened to eat nothing, the family, at
least the men, sat down with us. As to the women, they all pretended
to wait on us. My eyes wandered with delight around this room, so new
to me; the alcoves where the parents and older members of the family
slept, receded into the wall and were hidden by flowered curtains; the
wide chimney-piece was ornamented with a crucifix and plates imprinted
with historical subjects; a branch of consecrated box hung below; then
there were enormous spits and the imposing chimney-hook.</p>

<p>Yana placed on the table a tureen of cabbage and bacon soup, the smell
of which would have aroused the appetite of the dead.</p>

<p>We all made the sign of the cross, bowed our heads and clasped our
hands over the soup-basins, the savory smell from which rose towards
the smoky beam like the perfume of incense. For some seconds nothing
was audible save the lowing of the cows from the sheds, the buzzing of
flies on the window-panes, and the striking of S'Gravenwezel clock,
which rang out midday with the silvery, melancholy chimes of village
bells.</p>

<p>What a delicious meal we had! My father thought of all the most
expressive adjectives in the patois to express the merits of the soup,
I sang the praises of the eggs which served as a golden frame to the
red-and-white slices of ham. A mountain of mealy potatoes disappeared
beneath our lively forks. I had a healthy country appetite!</p>

<p>Yana, who was touched, declared that her master had not eaten so much
for a month.</p>

<p>We were obliged to taste all the products of the farm: butter, milk,
cream cheese, early vegetables, and fruit. I laughed at Yana, who had
thought it necessary to bring provisions. She did not know the
parental hospitality! But I no longer made fun of her forethought when
she brought out the contents of the wonderful basket: two bottles of
old wine and a plum tart of her own making, which she placed
triumphantly in the middle of the table. They all drank to my father's
health, to mine, and to our happy stay in S'Gravenwezel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5198" id="Page_5198">[Pg 5198]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is settled, then, that in a week's time you shall come to my
house-warming, you hear, all of you!" said my father definitely....
"And now, Djodgy, we must be going, for you are longing to see our
nest."...</p>

<p>Jan came with us. He walked behind with his sister. Lion ran backwards
and forwards, showing his joy by his wild leaps and bounds, and
chasing the small animals which he raised among the rye.</p>

<p>Poppies and cornflowers already lit up the changing ears of corn with
their bright color, and white or brown butterflies flitted above like
animated flowers. We had followed a path which ran across the
cornfields, behind Ambroes farm, to the left of the high road. Some
minutes later we skirted a little oak wood, and immediately behind it
my father pointed our home out to me.</p>

<p>Simple cottage! you haunt me still, above all in springtime, when the
air is warm and soft as on that memorable day.... Your white walls
will ever be to me a sad though sweet and loving memory.</p>

<p>The little house was simple and quiet as possible. There was one story
only, and it contained but four rooms. An out-house with hen-roost,
which would serve as a shed for the gardener, stood on one side.
Yana's brother had for the time being put into it a pretty white kid,
which bleated loudly at our approach; he ran to set it free.</p>

<p>Fruit-trees covered the wall facing south. The inclosure, encircled by
a hedge of beech, was half orchard, half pleasure garden, and covered
an area of three thousand metres. In front of the house was a square
lawn, divided by a path from the gate to the front door. Leafy copses
of plantain, chestnuts, American oaks, and birches, offered delightful
retreats on either side of the house for reading or dreaming. As we
went round the grounds, my father explained with animation the
improvements which he projected. Here was to be a clump of
rhododendrons, here a bed of Orleans roses, there a grove of lilacs.
He consulted me with a feverish "Hey?" He was excited, unreserved;
rarely had I seen him in such high spirits. Since the death of my
mother his beautiful, sonorous, and contagious laugh had been heard no
more.</p>

<p>Chattering thus, we came to a mound at the bottom of the garden, from
which we could see a corner of the village; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5199" id="Page_5199">[Pg 5199]</a></span> spire emerging from a
screen of limes, the crossed sails of a silent mill perched on a
grassy knoll, farms scattered among cornfields and meadows, until the
plain was lost in the horizon.</p>

<p>"Look, George," he said, "this will be our world in future.... It will
be good for us both to live here; for if I need solace, you will gain
equally.... No more confinement, my dear little fellow; we are rich
enough to live in the country as philosophers.... And when I am gone
... for one must provide for everything...." He stopped. I remember
that a broken-winded barrel organ ground out a polka behind the screen
of limes which shut off the village.</p>

<p>My father had suddenly become serious, and the solemnity of his last
words moved me deeply. Then that distant melancholy air made me
shudder. When he had finished speaking, he coughed for a long time.</p>

<p>We were seated on the slope, our backs to the house, facing the vast
plain, the silence of which was rendered more overwhelming by the
jarring notes of the barrel organ.</p>

<p>"Father," I murmured, as if in prayer, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>In reply he drew me towards him, took my head in his hands and looked
at me long, his eyes lost in mine; then he embraced me, attempted to
smile, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is nothing. I am well, am I not? Why do my family worry me with
their advice? Indeed, they will frighten me with their long faces and
perpetual visits.... To-day at least I have escaped from them.... We
two are alone ... free! Soon it will be always so!"</p>

<p>Despite this reanimation, an inexpressible agony wrung my heart, and I
made no effort to escape from this influence, which I felt to be due
to our deep sympathy.</p>

<p>Regret was already mingled with my delight; and on this exquisite
afternoon there was that heart-rending sense of things which have been
and will never be again&mdash;never.</p>

<p>I threw my arms round my father's neck, and made no other reply to his
last words. It required a mutual effort to break the silence; neither
of us made the effort. In the distance the organ continued to grind
out the tune as if it too were choked with sobs.</p>

<p>Thus we remained for long, until the day waned.</p>

<p>"Is it not time to go back, sir?"</p>

<p>Yana's interruptions aroused us. Silently my father got up, and with
my hand still in his we passed through the graying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5200" id="Page_5200">[Pg 5200]</a></span> country, where the
twilight already created fantastic shadows. At about a hundred yards
from the house he turned round, and made me look once more at the
little corner of earth, the hermitage which was to shelter us.</p>

<p>"We will call it Mon Repos!" he said, and he moved on.</p>

<p>Mon Repos! How he lingered over those three syllables. Even thus are
certain nocturnes of Chopin prolonged.</p>

<p>When we reached Ambroes farm, we took affectionate farewell of Yana's
family. My father thanked them for their welcome, and reminded them of
his invitation. He gave Jan a few further instructions about the
garden; the lad stood cap in hand, his dark eyes expressive of vivid
sympathy.</p>

<p>Yet another "au revoir"; then the carriage drove away, and we turned
our backs on the dear village.</p>

<p>Was it still the kermesse organ which obsessed me, lingering above all
other sounds, growing fainter and fainter but never quite dying away?
And why did I ceaselessly repeat to myself, whatever the music, these
three unimportant syllables "Mon Repos"?</p>

<p>The sun was setting when we reached the gates of the town. Country
masons, white and dusty, with tools over their shoulder and tins
hanging by their side, walked rapidly to the villages which we had
left behind. Happy workmen! They were wise to go back to the village,
and to leave the hideous slums of West Antwerp to their town comrades.</p>

<p>A fresh breeze had risen which stirred the tops of the aspens. The
purple light on the horizon beyond the ramparts grew faint. During the
whole drive my father remained sunk in prostration; his hands, which I
stroked, were moist; now burning, now icy. He roused himself from this
painful torpor only to slip his hand through my hair, and to smile at
me as never friend has smiled since.</p>

<p>Yana too looked sad now, and pretended that it was the dust which
caused her to wipe her eyes continually with her handkerchief.</p>

<p>I was tired, overcome with so much open air, but I could not fall
asleep that night. I dreamed with open eyes of the events of the day,
of the farm, of good-natured Jan, of the happy meal, of the kid, of
the coming day when I should be "<i>boer Jorss</i>," as the kind fellow
said.... I was happy, but from time to time a fit of terrible coughing
from the next room stifled me, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5201" id="Page_5201">[Pg 5201]</a></span> then I recalled the scene in the
garden, our silence against the jarring sound of the organ, and later
these two words "Mon Repos." I did not close my eyes until the
morning.</p>

<p>When I awoke, my uncle was already waiting for me. He was an old
officer and adhered to military time only.</p>

<p>"We must be off!" he said in his gruff, harsh voice. "You must go back
to work, my lad."</p>

<p>Must I go away again? Why this week's separation? What did my uncle's
authoritative tone mean in my father's house, in <i>our</i> house? Why did
Yana look at him respectfully but sullenly? I did not guess the
horrible but absolute necessity for this intrusion; it exasperated me.</p>

<p>What a bitter leave-taking! And that, too, for a week's separation
only. It was in vain that my uncle made fun of our tears. I clung to
my beloved father, and he had not the strength to repel me. The
impatient officer tore me at last from his embrace.</p>

<p>"The train does not wait!" he grumbled. "Were there ever such
chicken-hearted people!"</p>

<p>I was indignant.</p>

<p>"No, not at parting from you," I said to my unsympathetic relation,...
"but from him!"</p>

<p>"Djodgy! Djodgy!" my father tried to say in a tone of reproach.
"Forgive him, Henry.... Au revoir! In a week's time!... Be good ever."</p>

<p>This time Yana no longer tried to hide her tears. Lion moved sadly
from one to another, and his human eyes appeared to say, "Stay with
him."</p>

<p>But nothing would move my obdurate uncle. We drove away in the same
carriage which had taken us the day before to S'Gravenwezel.</p>

<p>We waved to one another as long as the carriage was in the street.</p>

<p>In a week I should see him again!</p>

<p>In a week he was dead!</p>

<p>But I have forgotten nothing.</p>

<p>Thus it is, ever since then, that I love, I adore this Flemish country
as my heritage from him who loved it above all others; from him, the
sole human being who never wrought me any ill. These vast pale-blue
horizons, often veiled with mist or fog, gleam before me again as that
tearful smile which I caught for the last time upon his dear face.</p>

<h3><a name="KORS_DAVIE" id="KORS_DAVIE"></a>KORS DAVIE</h3>

<h4>From 'The Massacre of the Innocents, and Other Tales by Belgian Writers':
copyrighted 1895, by Stone &amp; Kimball</h4>

<p>It was fair-time, yet Rika Let, the young dairymaid of <i>baes</i>
Verhulst, was sad.  She had worked so hard all August that
this morning, before mass, the <i>baezine</i> had given her a bright
florin and spoken kindly to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rika, it is fair-time for every one. Enjoy yourself, my girl.
Here is something to buy yourself a neckerchief at the fair, a
bright-colored one with fringe to cross over your breast."...</p>

<p>Rika accepted her mistress's present. Alone in her garret
above the stable, she turned the shining coin over and over, but
hesitated to exchange it for some coveted trifle at Suske Derk's
stall, down there by the church. Great tears sprang to her eyes,
eyes which were faintly tinged with green. What sorrow filled
the heart of this fair young girl of eighteen summers?</p>

<p>"Ah," she sighed, "if only one of the village lads would take
me to the fair and give me a gay kerchief! But who cares for
poor Rika? Our lads woo other girls, better born and richer than
I am! <i>Baezine</i> Verhulst knew that, or she would not have given
me money to buy a thing which the poorest laborer, or even the
humblest thresher, gives gladly to his sweetheart to-day....
Who will dance this evening with Rika Let at the Golden Swan?...
No one.... No, <i>baezine</i> Verhulst, it is not a f&ecirc;te day for
every one!"</p>

<p>Tears rested on her fair lashes as the morning dew clings to
the bearded ears of corn. Mechanically she looked at herself in
a piece of glass which hung beneath a little Notre-Dame of
Montaigu. She was not plainer than many of her companions
who were admired by the ardent and happy lovers. Ugly&mdash;Rika!
No indeed. Fair as the August cornfields of the Verhulsts were
her tresses. Her lips were red and full as ripe cherries. If you
feel aught of the charm of the young peasant girls of our country,
you would admire Rika.</p>

<p>She dressed herself in her simple Sunday clothes; a little collar
and flat cap, both of dazzling whiteness; a skirt and bodice,
unsoiled by any speck of dust.</p>

<p>The bell sounded for mass.</p>

<p>Go and pray, Rika! Who can say? the good God mayhap will
unseal the eyes of the blind gallants of Viersel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5203" id="Page_5203">[Pg 5203]</a></span></p>

<p>She told her beads so earnestly, that a friend had to remind
her when the service was at an end.</p>

<p>Outside the church a crowd of gay youths, with crossed arms and
flowers between their lips, watched the blushing procession of girls
who were to be their partners in the evening. Sympathetic glances were
exchanged, and with a smile or a simple movement of the head a meeting
was arranged, a promise confirmed, a consent given. Eager hearts
throbbed under the blue smocks, the many-colored kerchiefs; but no
glance sought to attract the bright eyes of the orphan girl, not one
of those young hearts beat in unison with hers.</p>

<p>To reach the farm, Rika had to pass through the fair. Suske Derk had
displayed her wares. Rika did not even deign to look at them. The
mercer called to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha! my pretty devotee! Won't you even wear a scapulary?"</p>

<p>At midday there was a great feast at the Verhulst farm in honor of the
fair. Masters, friends, and servants, all with big appetites, seated
themselves round a table laden with enormous dishes, brought in by the
farmer's wife and Rika. A savory smell filled the large room; the
steam dimmed the copper ornaments on the chimney-piece, the crucifix,
the candlesticks, the big plates, which were the pride of the cleanly
Rika. At first the guests, speechless, gravely and solemnly satisfied
their hunger. Then came the bumpers to wash down the viands, for mealy
Polder potatoes make one thirsty. As the tankards were re-filled,
tongues were loosed, and jokes piquant as the waters of the Scheldt
flew apace.</p>

<p>Rika in her turn sat down to the table, but the sorrow at her heart
robbed her of appetite, and she ate little. The lively guests,
distressed by her silence, attributed it to arrogance, and turned
their attention elsewhere. Later they would rejoin their buxom
wenches, and think no more of the poor little soul tormented with the
desire for love.</p>

<p>The more the day advanced, the less Rika thought of purchasing a fichu
at Suske Derk's stall; she would rather return the florin to her
mistress! Bugles and screeching fiddles could be heard from the Golden
Swan.</p>

<p><i>Houpsa!</i> rich and poor hasten to the dance, some in shoes, others in
sabots. <i>Lourelourela!</i> The quadrilles form. The couples hail their
vis-&agrave;-vis across the room. All is ready. They set off....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5204" id="Page_5204">[Pg 5204]</a></span></p>

<p>Rika alone is absent from the ball. Seated on the threshold of the
barn, the sound of the brass and wind instruments, the patter of feet,
the laughter and oaths, reach her ear.</p>

<p>The low-roofed houses of the village fade slowly in the twilight. The
church steeple rises heavenward as the watchful finger of God; at its
base lies the Golden Swan; against the four red-curtained windows the
figures of the dancing couples are outlined black as imps.</p>

<p>Rika could not tear herself away from this scene. Her heart, till now
pure as the veil of a first communicant, was filled with bitter
thoughts.</p>

<p>Marvelous tales were told of Zanne Hokespokes. The little old woman
possessed some wonderful secrets; she could give rot to sheep, make
cows run dry, and poison nurses' milk. She could see the fate of those
who consulted her in cards and in coffee-grounds. She could recall the
fickle lover to the side of the deserted maiden. Perhaps she could
find a sweetheart for lonely Rika?</p>

<p>Unholy thoughts rose with the oppressive mists of the evening. They
grew in the solitude, in the remoteness from others' joy. The ungainly
couples danced up and down, black as imps, against the four red
windows. The music grated and jarred; but for the last hour the
village steeple, which rose heavenward as the watchful finger of God,
had been lost in the darkness.</p>

<p>Would it be well to take advantage of the absence of her master and
mistress and consult the fortune-teller? No one would meet her. All
the village was at the Golden Swan.</p>

<p>Holy Virgin! how they are enjoying themselves! Among the whirling
couples Rika saw two figures intertwined, their faces so close that
their lips must meet!</p>

<p>Yes, she would have recourse to the spells of the old woman
Hokespokes, whatever might happen. She had still the bright coin in
her pocket. This and the few coppers which she had saved would
suffice.</p>

<p>The sorceress lived in a clay hut deep in the dark woods of Zoersel.
The peasants avoided these woods and passed through them in broad
daylight only, making the sign of the cross. At nightfall weird
melancholy sounds, which seemed to come from another world, murmured
in the tree-tops. It took an hour to reach the cottage from Viersel.
Rika calculated that she could be home before midnight. Her master and
mistress would not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5205" id="Page_5205">[Pg 5205]</a></span> return earlier than that. She overcame her last
fears, and set out bravely towards the lonely heath.</p>

<p>"In this bag, little one, are the ashes of the tooth of a corpse; the
tooth was picked up in the cemetery of Safftingen, the village that
was submerged by the Scheldt; therein is also a mushroom, called
'toadstool,' gathered at the foot of the tree on which Nol Bardaf the
cobbler was hanged. Next full moon, on a cloudless night, sprinkle the
magic powder at the foot of your bed, and prick the mushroom deeply
with a hairpin, uttering these words three times:&mdash;'I command thee,
charmed plant, to bring me the man who shall wound me as I wound
thee!' Then go to bed with the mushroom under your pillow, and wait in
perfect quiet without speaking. The beloved one will appear. Open your
eyes, but above all things neither speak nor move. You must even hold
your breath. If he leaves you, do not try to detain him. You will see
him again, and will then become his wife."</p>

<p>Thus spoke Zanne Hokespokes.</p>

<p>Rika followed the instructions of the sorceress. She waited several
days for the fine cloudless night, and when the full moon rose she did
as the witch had bidden her.</p>

<p>"I command thee, charmed thing, to bring me the man who shall wound me
as I wound thee!"</p>

<p>Once&mdash;twice&mdash;thrice.</p>

<p>Rika, with wide-open eyes and strained ear, lay in bed eagerly
awaiting the promised vision. Shadow became substance in the garret,
which was bathed in the silvery-blue beams of the moon. The silence
was so overwhelming that Rika thought she heard the sound of the white
light as it fell on the bare floor.</p>

<p>Now she regretted her traffic with a servant of the Devil, now she
rejoiced at the prospect of seeing <i>him</i>, the man who would love her;
but again she feared that he might not come.</p>

<p>The yard door swung on its hinges. A hasty, heavy step crossed the
court without disturbing the watch-dog. <i>He</i> opened the kitchen door.
<i>Clope! Clope!</i> rapidly he climbed the ladder which led to the attic.
Terror seized Rika; she stifled a cry, as the trap-door opened.</p>

<p>There he was in her room; a soldier, a young artilleryman. He passed
by her unnoticed in the white light of the moon.</p>

<p>Ah! Rika loves him at first sight; it is he for whom she has waited.
He has a round face, curly auburn hair, a well-cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5206" id="Page_5206">[Pg 5206]</a></span> mouth, a slightly
aquiline nose, with dilating nostrils, a square chin, and broad
shoulders. A fine mustache covers his upper lip. He wears a
brigadier's braids on his sleeve, and spurs on his heels. What mad
race has he been running? His broad chest rises and falls, he gasps
for breath, and throws himself down on the only stool. Rika longs to
rush to him, to wipe the sweat from his brow. As if overpowered, he
loosens his tunic, unclasps his belt, and exposes his fine chest.
Somewhat rested, oblivious of Rika, he scrutinizes his uniform from
head to foot, and notices that one of the buttonholes of his
boot-strap is torn. He takes off the strap, and with a knife which he
draws from his pocket makes a fresh hole in the leather. Then he
readjusts the strap to the trouser.</p>

<p>Rika observed all these movements. More and more she admired his
military bearing and the ease with which he moved. Animated by his
run, the soldier's face struck her as more expressive than the faces
of the other fellows of her acquaintance, even than the faces of the
scornful Odo and Freek, the Verhulsts' two sons, whom she had once
admired.</p>

<p>The stranger re-buttoned his coat, fastened his belt, put his cap on
his head, and left the room with the same quick firm step. She dared
not call to him and hold out her arms. The door closed.</p>

<p>The sound of his footsteps, the clank of his sword, were lost in the
distance. To Rika a memory only remained.</p>

<p>Has it not all been a dream, poor impressionable little thing?</p>

<p>No; a moment ago he sat quite near Rika's bed.</p>

<p>By the wan light of the moon she saw a sparkling object, the knife
which he had just used; here was her proof. She could no longer doubt.
She picked up the knife, pressed the still-open blade to her lips, and
as her breath dulled the steel, she wiped it, kissed it again; twenty
times she repeated the same childish trick.</p>

<p>Truly the good Zanne Hokespokes keeps her word. The pretty knife with
its tortoise-shell handle will henceforth be a pledge for Rika. Her
fingers lovingly caressed the blade, as if they stroked the mustache
of the brigadier; she would fain see her reflection in the dark eyes
of the beloved one, as she saw it in the shining metal.</p>

<p>Her eyes grew weary with gazing on the bright surface; she was
compelled to lie down. She slept and dreamt of her soldier visitor,
with the precious knife clasped to her breast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5207" id="Page_5207">[Pg 5207]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tarata!</span> Tarata! Tarata!</p>

<p>"Wake up, Kors Davie! ... Perhaps you're sorry to leave the barracks!
Confound it! the fellow snores as if he did not care for his holiday!"</p>

<p>Brigadier Warner Cats, Davie's fellow-countryman and comrade, tired of
speaking, shook Kors roughly, as the bugle sounded the r&eacute;veille. Kors
sat up, stretched himself, appeared astonished, and rubbed his eyes
with his fists.</p>

<p>"That's strange! Pouh! What a vile dream!" he muttered with a yawn.
"Comrade, just listen: I was out in the country, very much against my
will, I assure you.... A horrible old woman pursued me with repeated
blows. We crossed heath and swamp; my shoulder-belt and my sword
caught in the thickets; my skin was scratched with thorns.... I flew
over ditches three yards wide to escape from my persecutor. But the
wicked old woman galloped after me and belabored me incessantly.... I
was too much of a coward to turn and face her.... Oh! that race by
starlight!... I almost hated our beloved Campine,... for all this
happened in La Bruy&egrave;re.... But I'll be hanged if I know where!... Oh!
my legs, my poor legs.... You'll not believe, but I'm as exhausted...."</p>

<p>"Pouh! Pouh!" interrupted the faithful Warner Cats.... "Dreams are
lies! so my grandmother used to say. You'll have forgotten all about
these phantoms by the time you're beyond the ramparts, on the way to
our beautiful Wildonck, these phantoms will all vanish.... Be done
with grumbling.... Hang nightmares, if only the awakening is sweet!"</p>

<p>Kors got up, packed his kit, folded his blankets, and cheered by the
thought of his holiday, hummed a soldier's tune.</p>

<p>As he felt in his pocket he stopped suddenly. "Good heavens! I could
have sworn that I put it in my waistcoat pocket."</p>

<p>"What? What's up now, you grumbling devil?" asked Warner.</p>

<p>"Dash it! Begga Leuven's penknife, ... my Begga.... The pretty knife
which she bought me for my f&ecirc;te day when I was last in Antwerp."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I cannot find it!... There's a fine state of things.... What will
Begga say? I wanted to show her the little treasure still bright and
new. The dear soul will never forgive my carelessness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5208" id="Page_5208">[Pg 5208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense! she'll give you another.... Besides, it is not lucky to
give knives; they cut the bonds of love!" Warner added gravely; "they
bring misfortune."</p>

<p>"In the mean time, the bother is that I've lost the knife. Damn it!"</p>

<p>He turned his pockets inside out in vain.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I must make the best of it," he said at last.</p>

<p>When he was ready, he shook hands with his comrade and took up his
bundle.</p>

<p>"Au revoir!" said Warner. "Remember me to all friends, and drink a
pint to my health next Sunday at Maus Walkiers. Don't forget to go and
see my old parents, and tell them that my purse is as flat as a
pancake. Remember me also to Stans the wheelwright."</p>

<p>"Good. Are these all my orders?"</p>

<p>Davie hastened into the street.</p>

<p>Having left the town by the Vieux-Dieu fort, he followed the treeless
military road on a hot July morning. When he came within sight of the
spire of Wommelghem, he turned off by the short cut which led to Ranst
and Broechem. Here the copses and brushwood protected him from the
intense heat of the sun. He walked sharply, cap in hand, the sweat
standing on his brow. Over his shoulder he carried his bundle, tied in
a red handkerchief and fastened to a stick which he had cut on the
way. He stopped for a drink of beer at the toll-houses and
cross-roads, chatted with the barmaids if they took his fancy, then
went happily on. Towards midday he had passed through or skirted four
villages, and was a mile only from the home where his father and Begga
awaited him. As he recalled the bright healthy face of his young
sweetheart, the remembrance of his bad dream and of the loss of the
knife came back to him. Confounded knife! Kors could not separate the
thought of Begga from the lost treasure, and by a strange
contradiction of human nature he was almost angry with the poor girl,
because she had bought him this pocket-knife which had now come
between them. This ungenerous conclusion more and more took possession
of him. So preoccupied was he that he forgot to look where he was
going. Suddenly he noticed that he had gone astray.</p>

<p>He was about to cross a bridge over the Campine canal, though this
bridge did not really lie in his route. Beyond it, trees lined the
road on either side for a great distance. Between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5209" id="Page_5209">[Pg 5209]</a></span> the trunks could be
seen vast meadows, which stretched towards an immense purple heath,
bathed in soft mist. Four fine cows stood knee-deep in the
meadow-grass which fringed the banks of the canal; not far from the
cows a young girl with a branch in her hand sat on the slope guarding
them.</p>

<p>He called to her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hi, Mietje, come here!"</p>

<p>She sprang up, and jumped lightly over the fence, but when she came
within a few yards of the stranger she stopped, looked at him for a
moment, covered her face with her hands, and turned to go away. In a
few rapid strides the soldier overtook her, and caught her gently by
the arm. He was secretly flattered by the embarrassment of the young
peasant girl. Silent, but blushing red as a poppy, she looked down,
and the blue-green of her eyes could be seen beneath the fair lashes.
She tried to turn away and escape the scrutiny of the gallant.</p>

<p>"Bless me, what a pretty little puss!" he exclaimed. "Tell me, my
beautiful one, where do such dainty maidens come from?"</p>

<p>"I come from Viersel," she replied, in a very timid voice.</p>

<p>"Then we are neighbors, and almost fellow-villagers, for I live at
Wildonck, and was on my way thither."</p>

<p>"You will never reach it, if you follow this road."</p>

<p>"Egad! I don't deny it, my pretty one! A moment ago I thought myself a
fool for losing my way. Now I bless my stupidity."</p>

<p>She did not reply to this compliment, but flushed crimson.</p>

<p>He would not set her free. The vision of Begga, sullen and displeased
at the loss of the knife, grew fainter and fainter. In this frame of
mind he welcomed the stranger gladly, as a pleasant diversion from the
thoughts which had tormented him just before.</p>

<p>"What is your name, my flower of Viersel?"</p>

<p>"Hendrika Let&mdash;Rika."</p>

<p>"That has always been one of my favorite names. It was my mother's. Do
your parents live far from here?"</p>

<p>"My parents! I never knew them. I am a servant at <i>boer</i> Verhulst's,
whose farm you see down there, a short distance away behind the
alder-trees."</p>

<p>"You do not ask my name, Rika?"</p>

<p>She was burning to know the name of the beloved one, for he was indeed
the brilliant visitor of the enchanted night. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5210" id="Page_5210">[Pg 5210]</a></span> stilled the
throbbing of her beating heart, and pretended to show only the polite
indifference which an honest girl would feel to an agreeable passer-by
who accosted her on the road.</p>

<p>"You shrug your shoulders and pout, Rika! Of what interest is a
soldier's name to you? Probably he is a bad fellow, as the cur&eacute;
preaches,&mdash;a spendthrift, a deceiver of women. Well, I will tell you
all the same. I am Cornelis Davie, otherwise Kors, Kors the Black, now
brigadier in the first battery of the fifth regiment of artillery,
stationed at Fort IV., at Vieux-Dieu, near Antwerp. In two months I
shall return to Wildonck for good, and take up the management of the
Stork Farm, for old Davie has worked long enough. Then, Rika, Kors
Davie will marry. Can you not suggest some girl for him, my sweet
Rika? Do you think he will find some fair ones to choose from at
Viersel?"</p>

<p>"I think you are getting further and further away from Wildonck!" said
the coquette.</p>

<p>It was true; they had walked along together, and the canal was now far
behind them.</p>

<p>"You rogue!" said Kors, a little annoyed. "Why need you remind me of
the moment of parting?"</p>

<p>"If you follow this road, you may perhaps arrive to-morrow. Farewell,
my soldier. My cows may go astray as you have."</p>

<p>The happy girl pretended to move away. This time he seized her round
the waist, and holding her in his arms, repeated again and again. "You
are beautiful, Rika!"</p>

<p>"If our Viersel lads saw you so foolish, they would laugh at you. Are
there no girls at Wildonck, or in the town?"</p>

<p>"The devil take the lads of Viersel, the girls of Wildonck, and the
women of Antwerp! I will win you from all the men in your village,
sweet one! you are more beautiful to me than all the girls of my
native place! Rika, if you will consent, our marriage shall be fixed."</p>

<p>"This love will not last."</p>

<p>He pressed her more closely to him.</p>

<p>"Let me go, let me go, brigadier, or I shall scream. You have surely
been drinking. There are several inns between here and your fort, are
there not? What would people say if they met me with you? Ah! to the
right there is a road which branches off and will take you home. Be
off! Good-night!"</p>

<p>The susceptible Davie had now forgotten the very existence of the fair
and prudent Begga Leuven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5211" id="Page_5211">[Pg 5211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if it must be, I will go!" he said, in a firm yet tender voice.
"But one word more, Rika. If I return in three days' time; if I repeat
then that I love you madly; if I ask you to be my wife, will you
refuse me?"</p>

<p>"Cornelis Davie is making fun of Rika Let; land-owners do not marry
their farm servants."</p>

<p>"I swear that I am in earnest! I have one desire, one wish only. Rika,
when I return in three days' time, on Monday, will you meet me here?"</p>

<p>A feeble consent was wrung from her.</p>

<p>When Kors tried to kiss her lips, she had not the strength to resist;
she returned his kiss passionately.</p>

<p>Then, not without a pang, he walked rapidly in the direction of the
foot-path, not daring to look back.</p>

<p>Breathless with excitement and triumph, Rika followed him with her
eyes, until he was lost behind a leafy clump of oaks.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was fair-time again, but now Rika Let was happy; she dined at
Viersel with her former employers the Verhulsts, accompanied by her
husband, the fine Kors Davie of Wildonck, Kors the Black, the owner of
the Stork Farm.</p>

<p>Poor old Davie had fretted and died! Ah! the sorcery of old Zanne
Hokespokes was indeed potent; she had changed the loyal Kors into an
undutiful son and a faithless lover. Poor Begga was helpless against
the spells of the Devil. Nothing could do away with the power of the
incantation. "Do not be unhappy, sweet Begga! Marry tall Mil&egrave;, the
lock-keeper; he has neither the money nor the manly bearing of the
ex-brigadier, but he will love you better."</p>

<p>It was just a year ago, to the day, since Rika Let consulted the
witch. The poor dairymaid had reaped ample revenge for the slights
cast upon her. She wished to pay a visit to the Verhulsts' and
introduce her rich husband to them, for the Verhulsts' wealth was
nothing compared to that of the Davies.</p>

<p>Rika was gorgeously dressed. Think, <i>baezine</i> Verhulst, of offering
her a woolen kerchief from Suske Derk's stall! Feel the silk of her
dress; it cost ten francs a yard, neither more nor less. The lace on
her large f&ecirc;te-cap is worth the price of at least three fat pigs, and
the diamond heart, a jewel which belonged to the late <i>baezine</i> Davie,
the mother of Kors, hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5212" id="Page_5212">[Pg 5212]</a></span> round her throat on a massive gold chain,
is more valuable than all your trinkets!</p>

<p>At midday there was feasting at the Verhulsts' farm in honor of the
fair, and more especially to welcome the Davies. Masters, friends,
plowmen and haymakers, all with good appetite, seated themselves round
a table laden with enormous dishes brought in by the farmer's wife and
Rika's successor.</p>

<p>The obsequious Madame Verhulst overpowered her former servant with
attention.</p>

<p>"<i>Baezine</i> Davie, take one of these <i>carbonades</i>? They are soft as
butter.... A slice of ham? It's fit for a king. Or perhaps you will
have some more of this chine, which has been specially kept for your
visit? Or a spoonful of saffron rice? It melts in the mouth."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, Madame Verhulst, but we breakfasted late just
before starting.... Kors, have our horses been fed?"</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid, <i>baezine</i> Davie; Verhulst will see to that
himself."</p>

<p>Kors, who was more and more in love with his wife, presided at the
men's end of the table; near him sat Odo and Freek Verhulst, who had
formerly treated Rika so disdainfully. Kors, well shaven, rubicund,
merry, and wearing a dark-blue smock-frock, looked lovingly and
longingly in the direction of his wife.</p>

<p>A savory smell filled the large room, the steam dimmed the copper
ornaments on the chimney-piece, the crucifix, the candlesticks, the
plates, which were formerly the pride of the cleanly Rika.</p>

<p>At first the guests gravely and solemnly satisfied their hunger,
without saying a word. Then came the bumpers to wash down the viands,
for mealy Polder potatoes make one thirsty! As the tankards were
re-filled, tongues were loosed, and jokes piquant as the waters of the
Scheldt flew apace.</p>

<p>Later, coffee, together with white bread and butter, sprinkled with
currants, was served for the ladies. The men bestirred themselves
unwillingly. Silently and solemnly they filled their pipes and smoked,
while the old gossips and white-capped young girls chattered like
magpies. The low-roofed houses of the village, which stand at the foot
of the steeple pointing upward as the watchful finger of God, fade in
the gathering twilight.</p>

<p>Before the bugles and violins struck up in the Golden Swan, whither
<i>baezine</i> Davie was longing to go with her husband, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5213" id="Page_5213">[Pg 5213]</a></span> proud Rika
took him by the arm and showed him round the Verhulsts's farm. After
visiting the cowsheds, the stables, the pig-sties, and the dairy, they
climbed to the garret where Rika used to sleep. The same little camp
bed stood there, the same broken mirror, the solitary rickety stool. A
feeling of emotion, mingled perhaps with remorse, overcame the pretty
farmer's wife at sight of the familiar objects, and she threw herself
into her husband's arms. The young farmer kissed her passionately over
and over again. Rika sat on his knee with his arms around her, and
they were oblivious to all save their love....</p>

<p>Below in the court-yard shrill voices called to them; it was time for
the dances.</p>

<p>"There is no need to hasten, is there, my Rika?"</p>

<p>"Kors, my well-beloved," Rika said at last with a sigh, after a long
and delicious silence, "do you not remember this room?"</p>

<p>"What a strange question, little woman! you know this is the first
time I have crossed the threshold!"</p>

<p>"Are you certain?"</p>

<p>She laughed, amused at his puzzled, half-angry, half good-natured
look.</p>

<p>"Have you ever lost anything, Kors?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"Be done with riddles! Rather let us go and dance," replied Kors,
relieved for the moment by the strident tones of the music, and the
sound of dancing.</p>

<p><i>Houps! Lourelourela!</i> Rich and poor joined in the dance, their
figures outlined like black imps against the red windows of the Golden
Swan.</p>

<p>"One word more," said Rika, catching hold of Kors's blouse; "have you
no recollection of a little thing which you lost one night on a
journey?"</p>

<p>"No more enigmas for me, sweet one; let us be off. My feet itch for
the dance."</p>

<p>"Must I remind you?&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>She drew Begga Leuven's knife from her pocket.</p>

<p>He turned and held out his hand. At touch of the knife, the
remembrance of that strange night came back to him. Again he saw the
hideous old woman who pursued him with blows; he crossed heath and
swamp, his sword caught in the brushwood; he ran until he was
breathless.... But now he understood more than he did on that morning
when he told his nightmare to his loyal friend Warner Cats, the
intimate friend whom he had lost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5214" id="Page_5214">[Pg 5214]</a></span> in consequence of his willful
marriage.... He recognized this accursed garret, where he had lost the
pretty knife, a present from his first lover. Reason returned, and
with it all his pure and holy passion for Begga. She who was called
<i>baezine</i> Davie had won him by sorcery. To kiss her lips he forsook
Begga, his gentle comrade; later, he was deaf to the curses of his
grandfather, he was indifferent when Begga married tall Mil&egrave;, and he
shed no tears at the grave of the father whose death was brought about
by his disgraceful marriage.</p>

<p>And she, the abominable accomplice of the sorceress, still clung to
him,&mdash;the vampire!</p>

<p>The pale moon had risen, and now bathed the attic in silver rays
tinged with blue.</p>

<p>Rika sank to the ground beneath the unrecognizing glance of Kors; she
stretched out her hands to ward off what she felt must come.</p>

<p>In Black Kors's contracted, bloodless hand, the open knife shone as on
the night of the charm.</p>

<p>Between two harsh and vibrating strains of music which came from the
Golden Swan, a discordant burst of laughter echoed across the silent
tragic plain surrounding Verhulst Farm.</p>

<p>At that moment, Kors in a fit of delirium plunged the knife into
Rika's breast.... She fell without uttering a cry.</p>

<p>Did not the incantation run:&mdash;"I command thee, charmed plant, to bring
me the man who will wound me as I wound thee"?</p>

<h4>(1837-)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/cape.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="E" title="E" />
</div><p class="dropcap">dward Eggleston was born at Vevay, Indiana, December 10th, 1837. His
father was a native of Amelia County, Virginia, and was of a family
which migrated from England to Virginia in the seventeenth century,
and which became one of much distinction in the State. A brief
biography of Mr. Eggleston lately published affords some information
as to his early years. He was a sufferer from ill health as a child.
He had repeatedly to be removed from school for this cause, and he
spent a considerable part of his boyhood on farms in Indiana, where he
made acquaintance with that rude backwoods life which he has described
in 'The Hoosier Schoolmaster' and other stories. An important incident
of his youth was a visit of thirteen months which he paid to his
relations in Virginia in 1854. This opportunity of making acquaintance
under such favorable circumstances with slave society, must have been
of great value to one who was to make American history the chief
pursuit of his life. In 1856 he went to Minnesota, and there lived a
frontier life to the great improvement of his health. The accounts we
have of him show him to have had the ardent and energetic character
which belongs to the youth of the West. When not yet nineteen years
old he became a Methodist preacher in that State. Later, ill health
forced him again to Minnesota, where with the enthusiasm of a young
man he traveled on foot, shod in Indian moccasins, in winter and
summer preaching to the mixed Indian and white populations on the
Minnesota River.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Eggleston's literary career began, while he was still preaching,
with contributions to Western periodicals. Having written for the New
York Independent, he was offered in 1870 the place of literary editor
of that paper, and the following year became its editor-in-chief. He
was afterwards editor of Hearth and Home, to the columns of which
journal he contributed 'The Hoosier Schoolmaster,' a story that has
been very popular. He wrote a number of other novels, 'The End of the
World,' 'The Mystery of Metropolisville,' 'The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5216" id="Page_5216">[Pg 5216]</a></span>Circuit Rider,'
'Roxy,' etc. In January 1880, while on a visit to Europe, he began to
make plans for a 'History of Life in the United States.' He had always
had a strong taste for this subject, a keen natural interest in
history being evident here and there in his stories. His historical
researches were carried on in many of the chief libraries of Europe
and the United States. A result of these studies was the thirteen
articles on 'Life in the Colonial Period' published in the Century
Magazine. These, however, were but preliminary studies to the work
which he intended should be the most important of his life. The first
volume of this work, 'The Beginners of a Nation,' was published in
1896.</p>

<p>This work does not pretend to be a particular account of colonial
history. It is an attempt rather to describe the colonial individual
and colonial society, to state the succession of cause and effect in
the establishment of English life in North America, and to describe
principles rather than details,&mdash;giving however as much detail as is
necessary to illustrate principles. The volume of 1896 contains
chapters on 'The James River Experiments' and 'The Procession of
Motives' which led to colonization. Book ii. of this volume is upon
the Puritan migration, and has chapters on the rise of Puritanism in
England, on the Pilgrim migration, and the great Puritan exodus. Book
iii. receives the name of 'Centrifugal Forces in Colony Planting,' and
contains accounts of Lord Baltimore's Maryland colony, of Roger
Williams, and the 'New England Dispersions,' by which is meant the
establishment of communities in Connecticut and elsewhere. In the
sketch of Lord Baltimore, the courtier and friend of kings, we have a
striking contrast with the type of men who led the Puritan migrations.
There were odd characters in those days; and a court favorite and
worldling who, after having feathered his nest, is willing to make two
such voyages to Newfoundland as his must have been, and to spend a
winter there, all out of zeal for the establishment of his religion in
the Western wilds, is certainly a person worthy of study.</p>

<p>The play of the forces that produced emigration, and their relations
to the migrations, are described very clearly by the author. People
did not emigrate when they were happy at home. Thus, Catholic
emigration was small under Laud, when English Catholics were beginning
to think that the future was theirs; just as Puritan emigration,
vigorous under Laud, dwindled with the days of the Puritan triumph in
England. We have in 'The James River Experiments' a good example of
the writer's method. The salient and significant facts are given
briefly, but with sufficient fullness to enable the reader to have a
satisfactory grasp of the matter; and where some principle or general
truth is to be pointed out, the author sets <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5217" id="Page_5217">[Pg 5217]</a></span>this forth strongly. For
instance, in describing the motives of colonization in Virginia, he
shows how these motives were in almost all cases delusions; how a
succession of such delusions ran through the times of Elizabeth and
James; and how colonization succeeded in the end only by doing what
its projectors had never intended to do. The Jamestown emigrants
expected to find a passage to India, to discover gold and silver, to
raise wine and silk. But none of these things were done. Wines and
silk indeed were raised. It is said that Charles I.'s coronation robe
was made of Virginian silk, and Mr. Eggleston tells us that Charles
II. certainly wore silk from worms hatched and fed in his Virginian
dominions. But these industries, although encouraged to the utmost by
government, could not be made to take root. On the other hand, a
determined effort was made to discourage the production of tobacco.
James I. wrote a book against the culture of that pernicious "weed,"
as he was the first to describe it. But the hardy plant held its own
and flourished in spite of the royal disfavor. Nor were the colonists
more successful in their political intentions. Especially interesting,
in view of recent discussions, is the account given of the communistic
experiments which belonged to the early history of the American
colonies. In Virginia all the products of the colony were to go into a
common stock. But after twelve years' trial of this plan, there was a
division of the land among the older settlers. The pernicious
character of the system had been demonstrated. "Every man sharked for
his own bootie," says a writer on Virginia in 1609, "and was
altogether careless of the succeeding penurie." The two years of
communism in the Plymouth colony was scarcely more successful.
Bradford, finding that the matter was one of life and death with the
colony, abolished the system, although the abolition was a
revolutionary stroke, in violation of the contract with the
shareholders.</p>

<p>This idea, that the outcome was to be very different from the
intentions, appears not only in the striking chapter on 'The
Procession of Motives,' but crops up again and again in other parts of
the book. Thus, the ill success which attended the government of the
colonies from London resulted in the almost unconscious establishment
of several independent democratic communities in America. This
happened in Virginia and Plymouth. The Massachusetts Bay Colony,
however, was self-governing from the start.</p>

<p>But although causes and principles are matters of chief interest with
Mr. Eggleston, his book is full of a picturesqueness which is all the
more effective for being unobtrusive. The author has not that tiresome
sort of picturesqueness which insists on saying the whole thing
itself. The reader is credited with a little imagination, and that
faculty has frequent opportunity for exercise. It is charmed by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5218" id="Page_5218">[Pg 5218]</a></span>the
striking passage in which is described the delight of the emigrants of
the Massachusetts Bay Colony, when, after having set sail from
England, they found themselves upon the open sea for the first time
without the supervision, or even the neighborhood, of bosses. We know
the sense of freedom which the broad and blue ocean affords to us all;
what must have been that feeling to men who had scarcely ever had an
hour of life untroubled by the domination of an antagonistic religious
authority! Every day, for ten weeks together, they had preaching and
exposition. "On one ship," says Mr. Eggleston, "the watches were set
to the accompaniment of psalm-singing."</p>

<p>The candor and fair-mindedness of this work is one of its special
merits. We have an indication of this quality in the author's refusal
to accept the weak supposition, common among writers upon American
history, that the faults of our ancestors were in some way more
excusable than those of other people. He says in his Preface:&mdash;"I have
disregarded that convention which makes it obligatory for a writer of
American history to explain that intolerance in the first settlers was
not just like other intolerance, and that their cruelty and injustice
were justifiable under the circumstances." Other very important
characteristics are sympathy, warmth of heart, and moral enthusiasm.
Nor is the work wanting in an adequate literary merit. The style,
especially in the later chapters, is free, simple, nervous, and
rhythmical.</p>

<p>Little has been said of Mr. Eggleston's novels in the course of these
remarks. But the qualities of his historical writing appear in his
novels. The qualities of the realistic novelist are of great use to
the historian, when the novelist has the thoroughness and the industry
of Mr. Eggleston. By the liveliness of his imagination, he succeeds in
making history as real as fiction should be. Mr. Eggleston's novels
deserve the popularity they have attained. They are themselves,
particularly those which describe Western life, valuable contributions
to history. The West, we may add, is Mr. Eggleston's field. His most
recent novel, 'The Faith Doctor,' the scene of which is laid in New
York, is very inferior to his Western stories. Of these novels
probably the best is 'The Graysons,' a book full of its author's
reality and warmth of human sympathy; of this book the reader will
follow every word with the same lively interest with which he reads
'The Beginners of a Nation.'</p>

<h3><a name="ROGER_WILLIAMS_THE_PROPHET_OF_RELIGIOUS_FREEDOM" id="ROGER_WILLIAMS_THE_PROPHET_OF_RELIGIOUS_FREEDOM"></a>ROGER WILLIAMS: THE PROPHET OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM</h3>
<h4>From 'The Beginners of a Nation': copyright 1896, by Edward Eggleston</h4>

<p>Local jealousy and sectarian prejudice have done what they could to
obscure the facts of the trial and banishment of Williams. It has been
argued by more than one writer that it was not a case of religious
persecution at all, but the exclusion of a man dangerous to the State.
Cotton, with characteristic verbal legerdemain, says that Williams was
"enlarged" rather than banished. The case has even been pettifogged in
our own time by the assertion that the banishment was only the action
of a commercial company excluding an uncongenial person from its
territory. But with what swift indignation would the Massachusetts
rulers of the days of Dudley and Haynes have repudiated a plea which
denied their magistracy! They put so strong a pressure on Stoughton,
who said that the assistants were not magistrates, that he made haste
to renounce his pride of authorship and to deliver his booklet to be
officially burned; nor did even this prevent his punishment. The
rulers of "the Bay" were generally frank advocates of religious
intolerance; they regarded toleration as a door set open for the Devil
to enter. Not only did they punish for unorthodox expressions, they
even assumed to inquire into private beliefs. Williams was only one of
scores bidden to depart on account of opinion.</p>

<p>The real and sufficient extenuation for the conduct of the
Massachusetts leaders is found in the character and standards of the
age. A few obscure and contemned sectaries&mdash;Brownists, Anabaptists,
and despised Familists&mdash;in Holland and England had spoken more or less
clearly in favor of religious liberty before the rise of Roger
Williams, but nobody of weight or respectable standing in the whole
world had befriended it. All the great authorities in Church and
State, Catholic and Protestant, prelatical and Puritan, agreed in
their detestation of it. Even Robinson, the moderate pastor of the
Leyden Pilgrims, ventured to hold only to the "toleration of tolerable
opinions." This was the toleration found at Amsterdam and in some
other parts of the Low Countries. Even this religious sufferance,
which did not amount to liberty, was sufficiently despicable in the
eyes of that intolerant age to bring upon the Dutch the contempt of
Christendom. It was a very qualified and limited toleration, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5220" id="Page_5220">[Pg 5220]</a></span> one
from which Catholics and Arminians were excluded. It seems to have
been that practical amelioration of law which is produced more
effectually by commerce than by learning or religion. Outside of some
parts of the Low Countries, and oddly enough of the Turkish Empire,
all the world worth counting decried toleration as a great crime. It
would have been wonderful indeed if Massachusetts had been superior to
the age. "I dare aver," says Nathaniel Ward, the New England
lawyer-minister, "that God doth nowhere in his Word tolerate Christian
States to give tolerations to such adversaries of his Truth, if they
have power in their hands to suppress them." To set up toleration was
"to build a sconce against the walls of heaven to batter God out of
his chair," in Ward's opinion.</p>

<p>This doctrine of intolerance was sanctioned by many refinements of
logic, such as Cotton's delicious sophistry that if a man refused to
be convinced of the truth, he was sinning against conscience, and
therefore it was not against the liberty of conscience to coerce him.
Cotton's moral intuitions were fairly suffocated by logic. He declared
that men should be compelled to attend religious service, because it
was "better to be hypocrites than profane persons. Hypocrites give God
part of his due, the outward man, but the profane person giveth God
neither outward nor inward man." To reason thus is to put subtlety
into the <i>cathedra</i> of common-sense, to bewilder vision by
legerdemain. Notwithstanding his natural gift for devoutness and his
almost immodest godliness, Cotton was incapable of high sincerity. He
would not specifically advise Williams's banishment, but having
labored with him round a corner according to his most approved
ecclesiastical formula, he said, "We have no more to say in his
behalf, but must sit down;" by which expression of passivity he gave
the signal to the "secular arm" to do its worst, while he washed his
hands in innocent self-complacency. When one scrupulous magistrate
consulted him as to his obligation in Williams's case, Cotton answered
his hesitation by saying, "You know they are so much incensed against
his course that it is not your voice, nor the voice of two or three
more, that can suspend the sentence." By such shifty phrases he
shirked responsibility for the results of his own teaching. Of the
temper that stands alone for the right, nature had given him not a
jot. Williams may be a little too severe, but he has some truth when
he describes Cotton on this occasion as "swimming with the stream of
outward credit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5221" id="Page_5221">[Pg 5221]</a></span> and profit," though nothing was further from Cotton's
conscious purpose than such worldliness. Cotton's intolerance was not
like that of Dudley and Endicott, the offspring of an austere temper;
it was rather the outgrowth of his logic and his reverence for
authority. He sheltered himself behind the examples of Elizabeth and
James I., and took refuge in the shadow of Calvin, whose burning of
Servetus he cites as an example, without any recoil of heart or
conscience. But the consideration of the character of the age forbids
us to condemn the conscientious men who put Williams out of the
Massachusetts theocracy as they would have driven the Devil out of the
garden of Eden. When, however, it comes to judging the age itself, and
especially to judging the Puritanism of the age, these false and harsh
ideals are its sufficient condemnation. Its government and its very
religion were barbarous; its Bible, except for mystical and
ecclesiastical uses, might as well have closed with the story of the
Hebrew judges and the imprecatory Psalms. The Apocalypse of John,
grotesquely interpreted, was the one book of the New Testament that
received hearty consideration, aside from those other New Testament
passages supposed to relate to a divinely appointed ecclesiasticism.
The humane pity of Jesus was unknown not only to the laws, but to the
sermons of the time. About the time of Williams's banishment the
lenity of John Winthrop was solemnly rebuked by some of the clergy and
rulers as a lax imperiling of the safety of the gospel; and Winthrop,
overborne by authority, confessed, explained, apologized, and promised
amendment. The Puritans substituted an unformulated belief in the
infallibility of "godly" elders acting with the magistrates, for the
ancient doctrine of an infallible Church.</p>

<p>In this less scrupulous but more serious age it is easy to hold
Williams up to ridicule. Never was a noble and sweet-spirited man
bedeviled by a scrupulosity more trivial. Cotton aptly dubbed him "a
haberdasher of small questions." His extant letters are many of them
vibrant with latent heroism; there is manifest in them an exquisite
charity and a pathetic magnanimity: but in the midst of it all the
writer is unable to rid himself of a swarm of scruples as pertinacious
as the buzzing of mosquitoes in the primitive forest about him. In
dating his letters, where he ventures to date at all, he never writes
the ordinary name of the day of the week or the name of the month,
lest he should be guilty of etymological heathenism. He often avoids<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5222" id="Page_5222">[Pg 5222]</a></span>
writing the year, and when he does insert it he commits himself to the
last two figures only and adds a saving clause. Thus 1652 appears as
"52 (so called)," and other years are tagged with the same doubting
words, or with the Latin "<i>ut vulgo</i>." What quarrel the tender
conscience had with the Christian era it is hard to guess. So too he
writes to Winthrop, who had taken part in his banishment, letters full
of reverential tenderness and hearty friendship. But his conscience
does not allow him even to seem to hold ecclesiastical fellowship with
a man he honors as a ruler and loves as a friend. Once at least he
guards the point directly by subscribing himself "Your worship's
faithful and affectionate in all <i>civil</i> bonds." It would be sad to
think of a great spirit so enthralled by the scrupulosity of his time
and his party, if these minute restrictions had been a source of
annoyance to him. But the cheerful observance of little scruples seems
rather to have taken the place of a recreation in his life; they were
to him perhaps what bric-&agrave;-brac is to a collector, what a
well-arranged altar and candlesticks are to a ritualist.</p>

<p>Two fundamental notions supplied the motive power of every
ecclesiastical agitation of that age. The notion of a succession of
churchly order and ordinance from the time of the apostles was the
mainspring of the High Church movement. Apostolic primitivism was the
aim of the Puritan, and still more the goal of the Separatist. One
party rejoiced in a belief that a mysterious apostolic virtue had
trickled down through generations of bishops and priests to its own
age; the other rejoiced in the destruction of institutions that had
grown up in the ages, and in getting back to the primitive nakedness
of the early Christian conventicle. True to the law of his nature,
Roger Williams pushed this latter principle to its ultimate
possibilities. If we may believe the accounts, he and his followers at
Providence became Baptists that they might receive the rite of baptism
in its most ancient Oriental form. But in an age when the fountains of
the great deep were utterly broken up, he could find no rest for the
soles of his feet. It was not enough that he should be troubled by the
Puritan spirit of apostolic primitivism: he had now swung round to
where this spirit joined hands with its twin, the aspiration for
apostolic succession. He renounced his baptism because it was without
apostolic sanction, and announced himself of that sect which was the
last reduction of Separatism. He became a Seeker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5223" id="Page_5223">[Pg 5223]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again is a probable influence from Holland. The Seekers had
appeared there long before. Many Baptists had found that their search
for primitivism, if persisted in, carried them to this negative
result; for it seemed not enough to have apostolic rites in apostolic
form unless they were sanctioned by the "gifts" of the apostolic time.
The Seekers appeared in England as early as 1617, and during the
religious turmoils of the Commonwealth period the sect afforded a
resting-place for many a weather-beaten soul. As the miraculous gifts
were lost, the Seekers dared not preach, baptize, or teach; they
merely waited, and in their mysticism they believed their waiting to
be an "upper room" to which Christ would come. It is interesting to
know that Williams, the most romantic figure of the whole Puritan
movement, at last found a sort of relief from the austere externalism
and ceaseless dogmatism of his age by traveling the road of
literalism, until he had passed out on the other side into the region
of devout and contented uncertainty.</p>

<p>In all this, Williams was the child of his age, and sometimes more
childish than his age. But there were regions of thought and sentiment
in which he was wholly disentangled from the meshes of his time, and
that not because of intellectual superiority,&mdash;for he had no large
philosophical views,&mdash;but by reason of elevation of spirit. Even the
authority of Moses could not prevent him from condemning the harsh
severity of the New England capital laws. He had no sentimental
delusions about the character of the savages,&mdash;he styles them "wolves
endued with men's brains"; but he constantly pleads for a humane
treatment of them. All the bloody precedents of Joshua could not make
him look without repulsion on the slaughter of women and children in
the Pequot war, nor could he tolerate dismemberment of the dead or the
selling of Indian captives into perpetual slavery. From bigotry and
resentment he was singularly free. On many occasions he joyfully used
his ascendency over the natives to protect those who kept in force
against him a sentence of perpetual banishment. And this
ultra-Separatist, almost alone of the men of his time, could use such
words of catholic charity as those in which he speaks of "the people
of God wheresoever scattered about Babel's banks, either in Rome or
England."</p>

<p>Of his incapacity for organization or administration we shall have to
speak hereafter. But his spiritual intuitions, his moral insight, his
genius for justice, lent a curious modernness to many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5224" id="Page_5224">[Pg 5224]</a></span> of his
convictions. In a generation of creed-builders which detested schism,
he became an individualist. Individualist in thought, altruist in
spirit, secularist in governmental theory, he was the herald of a time
yet more modern than this laggard age of ours. If ever a soul saw a
clear-shining inward light, not to be dimmed by prejudices or obscured
by the deft logic of a disputatious age, it was the soul of Williams.
In all the region of petty scrupulosity the time-spirit had enthralled
him; but in the higher region of moral decision he was utterly
emancipated from it. His conclusions belong to ages yet to come.</p>

<p>This union of moral aspiration with a certain disengagedness
constitutes what we may call the prophetic temperament. Bradford and
Winthrop were men of high aspiration, but of another class. The reach
of their spirits was restrained by practical wisdom, which compelled
them to take into account the limits of the attainable. Not that they
consciously refused to follow their logic to its end, but that, like
other prudent men of affairs, they were, without their own knowledge
or consent, turned aside by the logic of the impossible. Precisely
here the prophet departs from the reformer. The prophet recks nothing
of impossibility; he is ravished with truth disembodied. From Elijah
the Tishbite to Socrates, from Socrates to the latest and perhaps yet
unrecognized voice of our own time, the prophetic temperament has ever
shown an inability to enter into treaty with its environment. In the
seventeenth century there was no place but the wilderness for such a
John Baptist of the distant future as Roger Williams. He did not
belong among the diplomatic builders of churches, like Cotton, or the
politic founders of States, like Winthrop. He was but a babbler to his
own time; but the prophetic voice rings clear and far, and ever
clearer as the ages go on.</p>

<h2><a name="EGYPTIAN_LITERATURE" id="EGYPTIAN_LITERATURE"></a>EGYPTIAN LITERATURE</h2>

<h4>BY FRANCIS LLEWELLYN GRIFFITH AND KATE BRADBURY GRIFFITH</h4>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he advance that has been made in recent years in the decipherment of
the ancient writings of the world enables us to deal in a very
matter-of-fact way with the Egyptian inscriptions. Their chief
mysteries are solved, their philosophy is almost fathomed, their
general nature is understood. The story they have to tell is seldom
startling to the modern mind. The world was younger when they were
written. The heart of man was given to devious ways then, as now and
in the days of Solomon,&mdash;that we can affirm full well; but his mind
was simpler: apart from knowledge of men and the conduct of affairs,
the educated Egyptian had no more subtlety than a modern boy of
fifteen, or an intelligent English rustic of a century ago.</p>

<p>To the Egyptologist by profession the inscriptions have a wonderful
charm. The writing itself in its leading form is the most attractive
that has ever been seen. Long rows of clever little pictures of
everything in heaven and earth compose the sentences: every sign is a
plaything, every group a pretty puzzle, and at present, almost every
phrase well understood brings a tiny addition to the sum of the
world's knowledge. But these inscriptions, so rich in facts that
concern the history of mankind and the progress of civilization,
seldom possess any literary charm. If pretentious, as many of them
are, they combine bald exaggeration with worn-out simile, in which
ideas that may be poetical are heaped together in defiance of art.
Such are the priestly laudations of the kings by whose favor the
temples prospered. Take, for instance, the dating of a stela erected
under Rameses II. on the route to the Nubian gold mines. It runs:&mdash;</p>

his body, Lord of Diadems <i>Rameses Beloved of Amen</i>, giving life for
ever and ever like his father Ra, day by day." [Revised from the
German translation of Professor Erman.]</p></div>

<p>As Professor Erman has pointed out, the courtly scribe was most
successful when taking his similes straight from nature, as in the
following description, also of Rameses II.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A victorious lion putting forth its claws while roaring loudly and
uttering its voice in the Valley of the Gazelles.... A jackal swift of
foot seeking what it may find, going round the circuit of the land in
one instant.... his mighty will seizeth on his enemies like a flame
catching the ki-ki plant<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
with the storm behind it, like the strong
flame which hath tasted the fire, destroying, until everything that is
in it becometh ashes; a storm howling terribly on the sea, its waves
like mountains, none can enter it, every one that is in it is
engulphed in Duat.<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>"</p></div>

<p>Here and there amongst the hieroglyphic inscriptions are found
memorials of the dead, in which the praises of the deceased are neatly
strung together and balanced like beads in a necklace, and passages
occur of picturesque narrative worthy to rank as literature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5227" id="Page_5227">[Pg 5227]</a></span>
of the olden time. We may quote in this connection from the biographical
epitaph of the nomarch Ameny, who was governor of a province in Middle
Egypt for twenty-five years during the long reign of Usertesen I.
(about 2700 B.C.). This inscription not only recounts the achievements
of Ameny and the royal favor which was shown him, but also tells us in
detail of the capacity, goodness, charm, discretion, and insight by
which he attached to himself the love and respect of the whole court,
and of the people over whom he ruled and for whose well-being he
cared. Ameny says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was a possessor of favor, abounding in love, a ruler who loved his
city. Moreover I passed years as ruler in the Oryx nome. All the works
of the house of the King came into my hand. Behold, the superintendent
of the gangs<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
of the domains of the herdsmen of the Oryx nome gave me 3,000 bulls of
their draught stock. I was praised for it in the house of the King
each year of stock-taking. I rendered all their works to the King's
house: there were no arrears to me in any of his offices.</p>

<p>"The entire Oryx nome served me in numerous
attendances.<a name="FNanchor_2_10" id="FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
There was not the daughter of a poor man that I wronged, nor a widow that I
oppressed. There was not a farmer that I chastised, not a herdsman
whom I drove away, not a foreman of five whose men I took away for the
works.<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
There was not a pauper around me, there was not a hungry man
of my time. When there came years of famine, I arose and ploughed all
the fields of the Oryx nome to its boundary south and north, giving
life to its inhabitants, making its provisions. There was not a hungry
man in it. I gave to the widow as to her that possessed a husband, and
I favored not the elder above the younger in all that I gave.
Thereafter great rises of the Nile took place, producing wheat and
barley, and producing all things abundantly, but I did not exact the
arrears of farming."</p></div>

<p>Elsewhere in his tomb there are long lists of the virtues of
Amenemhat, and from these the following may be selected both on
account of picturesqueness of expression and the appreciation of fine
character which they display.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Superintendent of all things which heaven gives and earth produces,
overseer of horns, hoofs, feathers, and shells ... Master of the art
of causing writing to speak ... Caressing of heart to all people,
making to prosper the timid man, hospitable to all, escorting
[travelers] up and down the river ... Knowing how to aid, arriving at
time of need; free of planning evil, without greediness in his body,
speaking words of truth....
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5228" id="Page_5228">[Pg 5228]</a></span>
Unique as a mighty hunter, the abode of the heart of the King....
Speaking the right when he judges between suitors, clear of speaking
fraud, knowing how to proceed in the council of the elders, finding
the knot in the skein.... Great of favors in the house of the King,
contenting the heart on the day of making division, careful of his
goings to his equals, gaining reverence on the day of weighing words,
beloved of the officials of the palace."</p></div>

<p>The cursive forms of writing&mdash;hieratic from the earliest times,
demotic in the latest&mdash;were those in which records were committed to
papyrus. This material has preserved to us documents of every kind,
from letters and ledgers to works of religion and philosophy. To
these, again, "literature" is a term rarely to be applied; yet the
tales and poetry occasionally met with on papyri are perhaps the most
pleasing of all the productions of the Egyptian scribe.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the knowledge of writing in Egypt led to a
kind of primitive pedantry, and a taste for unnatural and to us
childish formality: the free play and na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the story-teller is
too often choked, and the art of literary finish was little
understood. Simplicity and truth to nature alone gave lasting charm,
for though adornment was often attempted, their rude arts of literary
embellishment were seldom otherwise than clumsily employed.</p>

<p>A word should be said about the strange condition in which most of the
literary texts have come down to us. It is rarely that monumental
inscriptions contain serious blunders of orthography; the
peculiarities of late archaistic inscriptions which sometimes produce
a kind of "dog Egyptian" can hardly be considered as blunders, for the
scribe knew what meaning he intended to convey. But it is otherwise
with copies of literary works on papyrus. Sometimes these were the
productions of schoolboys copying from dictation as an exercise in the
writing-school, and the blank edges of these papyri are often
decorated with essays at executing the more difficult signs. The
master of the school would seem not to have cared what nonsense was
produced by the misunderstanding of his dictation, so long as the
signs were well formed. The composition of new works on the model of
the old, and the accurate understanding of the ancient works, were
taught in a very different school, and few indeed attained to skill in
them. The boys turned out of the writing-school would read and write a
little; the clever ones would keep accounts, write letters, make out
reports as clerks in the government service, and might ultimately
acquire considerable proficiency in this kind of work. Apparently men
of the official class sometimes amused themselves with puzzling over
an ill-written copy of some ancient tale, and with trying to copy
portions of it. The work however was beyond them: they were attracted
by it, they revered the compilations <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5229" id="Page_5229">[Pg 5229]</a></span>of an elder age and those which
were "written by the finger of Thoth himself"; but the science of
language was unborn, and there was little or no systematic instruction
given in the principles of the ancient grammar and vocabulary. Those
who desired to attain eminence in scholarship after they had passed
through the writing-school had to go to Heliopolis, Hermopolis, or
wherever the principal university of the time might be, and there sit
at the feet of priestly professors; who we fancy were reverenced as
demigods, and who in mysterious fashion and with niggardly hand
imparted scraps of knowledge to their eager pupils. Those endowed with
special talents might after almost lifelong study become proficient in
the ancient language. Would that we might one day discover the hoard
of rolls of such a copyist and writer!</p>

<p>There must have been a large class of hack-copyists practiced in
forming characters both uncial and cursive. Sometimes their copies of
religious works are models of deft writing, the embellishments of
artist and colorist being added to those of the calligrapher: the
magnificent rolls of the 'Book of the Dead' in the British Museum and
elsewhere are the admiration of all beholders. Such manuscripts
satisfy the eye, and apparently neither the multitude in Egypt nor
even the priestly royal undertakers questioned their efficacy in the
tomb. Yet are they very apples of Sodom to the hieroglyphic scholar;
fair without, but ashes within. On comparing different copies of the
same text, he sees in almost every line omissions, perversions,
corruptions, until he turns away baffled and disgusted. Only here and
there is the text practically certain, and even then there are
probably grammatical blunders in every copy. Nor is it only in the
later papyri that these blunders are met with. The hieroglyphic system
of writing, especially in its cursive forms, lends itself very readily
to perversion by ignorant and inattentive copyists; and even
monumental inscriptions, so long as they are mere copies, are usually
corrupted. The most ridiculous perversions of all, date from the
Ramesside epoch when the dim past had lost its charm, for the glories
of the XVIIIth Dynasty were still fresh, while new impulses and
foreign influence had broken down adherence to tradition and
isolation.</p>

<p>In the eighth century B.C. the new and the old were definitely parted,
to the advantage of each. On the one hand the transactions of ordinary
life were more easily registered in the cursive demotic script, while
on the other the sacred writings were more thoroughly investigated and
brought into order by the priests. Hence, in spite of absurdities that
had irremediably crept in, the archaistic texts copied in the XXVIth
Dynasty are more intelligible than the same class of work in the XIXth
and XXth Dynasties.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5230" id="Page_5230">[Pg 5230]</a></span></p>

<p>In reading translations from Egyptian, it must be remembered that
uncertainty still remains concerning the meanings of multitudes of
words and phrases. Every year witnesses a great advance in accuracy of
rendering; but the translation even of an easy text still requires
here and there some close and careful guesswork to supply the
connecting links of passages or words that are thoroughly
understood, or the resort to some conventional rendering that has
become current for certain ill-understood but frequently recurring
phrases. The renderings given in the following pages are with one
exception specially revised for this publication, and exclude most of
what is doubtful. The Egyptologist is now to a great extent himself
aware whether the ground on which he is treading is firm or
treacherous; and it seems desirable to make a rule of either giving
the public only what can be warranted as sound translation, or else of
warning them where accuracy is doubtful. A few years ago such a course
would have curtailed the area for selection to a few of the simplest
stories and historical inscriptions; but now we can range over almost
the whole field of Egyptian writing, and gather from any part of it
warranted samples to set before the reading public. The labor,
however, involved in producing satisfactory translations for
publication, not mere hasty readings which may give something of the
sense, is very great; and at present few texts have been well
rendered. It is hoped that the following translations will be taken
for what they are intended,&mdash;attempts to show a little of the Ancient
Egyptian mind in the writings which it has left to us.</p>

<p>We may now sketch briefly the history of Egyptian literature, dealing
with the subject in periods:<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;</p>

<h4>I. <span class="smcap">The Ancient Kingdom, about B.C.</span> 4500-3000</h4>

<p>The earliest historic period&mdash;from the Ist Dynasty to the IIId, about
B.C. 4500&mdash;has left no inscriptions of any extent. Some portions of
the 'Book of the Dead' profess to date from these or earlier times,
and probably much of the religious literature is of extremely ancient
origin. The first book of *'Proverbs' in the Prisse Papyrus is
attributed by its writer to the end of the IIId Dynasty (about 4000
B.C.). From the IVth Dynasty to the end of the VIth, the number of the
inscriptions increases; tablets set up to the kings of the IVth
Dynasty in memory of warlike raids are found in the peninsula of
Sinai, and funerary inscriptions abound. The pyramids raised at the
end of the Vth and during the VIth Dynasty are found to contain
interminable religious inscriptions, forming almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5231" id="Page_5231">[Pg 5231]</a></span>
complete rituals for the deceased kings. Professor Maspero, who has published these
texts, states that they "contain much verbiage, many pious platitudes,
many obscure allusions to the affairs of the other world, and amongst
all this rubbish some passages full of movement and wild energy, in
which poetical inspiration and religious emotion are still discernible
through the veil of mythological expressions." Of the funerary and
biographical inscriptions the most remarkable is that of *Una.
Another, slightly later but hardly less important, is on the fa&ccedil;ade of
the tomb of Herkhuf, at Asw&acirc;n, and recounts the expeditions into
Ethiopia and the southern oases which this resourceful man carried
through successfully. In Herkhuf's later life he delighted a boy King
of Egypt by bringing back for him from one of his raids a grotesque
dwarf dancer of exceptional skill: the young Pharaoh sent him a long
letter on the subject, which was copied in full on the tomb as an
addition to the other records there. It is to the Vth Dynasty also
that the second collection of *'Proverbs' in the Prisse Papyrus is
dated. The VIIth and VIIIth Dynasties have left us practically no
records of any kind.</p>

<h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Middle Kingdom</span>, B.C. 3000 TO 1600</h4>

<p>The Middle Kingdom, from the IXth to the XVIIth Dynasty, shows a great
literary development. Historical records of some length are not
uncommon. The funerary inscriptions descriptive of character and
achievement are often remarkable.</p>

<p>Many papyri of this period have survived: the *Prisse Papyrus of
'Proverbs,' a papyrus discovered by Mr. Flinders Petrie with the
*'Hymn to Usertesen III.,' papyri at Berlin containing a *dialogue
between a man and his soul, the *'Story of Sanehat,' the 'Story of the
Sekhti,' and a very remarkable fragment of another story; besides the
'Westcar Papyrus of Tales' and at St. Petersburg the *'Shipwrecked
Sailor.' The productions of this period were copied in later times;
the royal *'Teaching of Amenemhat,' and the worldly *'Teaching of
Dauf' as to the desirability of a scribe's career above any other
trade or profession, exist only in late copies. Doubtless much of the
later literature was copied from the texts of the Middle Kingdom.
There are also *treatises extant on medicine and arithmetic. Portions
of the Book of the Dead are found inscribed on tombs and sarcophagi.</p>


<h4>III. <span class="smcap">The New Kingdom, etc.</span></h4>

<p>From the New Kingdom, B.C. 1600-700, we have the *'Maxims of Any,'
spoken to his son Khonsuhetep, numerous hymns to the gods, including
*that of King Akhenaten to the Aten (or disk of the sun), and the
later *hymns to Amen Ra. Inscriptions of every kind, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5232" id="Page_5232">[Pg 5232]</a></span>historical,
mythological, and funereal, abound. The historical *inscription of
Piankhy is of very late date. On papyri there are the stories of the
*'Two Brothers,' of the 'Taking of Joppa,' of the *'Doomed Prince.'</p>

<p>From the Saite period (XXVIth Dynasty, B.C. 700) and later, there is
little worthy of record in hieroglyphics: the inscriptions follow
ancient models, and present nothing striking or original. In demotic
we have the *'Story of Setna,' a papyrus of moralities, a chronicle
somewhat falsified, a harper's song, a philosophical dialogue between
a cat and a jackal, and others.</p>

<p>Here we might end. Greek authors in Egypt were many: some were native,
some of foreign birth or extraction, but they all belong to a
different world from the Ancient Egyptian. With the adaptation of the
Greek alphabet to the spelling of the native dialects, Egyptian came
again to the front in Coptic, the language of Christian Egypt. Coptic
literature, if such it may be called, was almost entirely produced in
Egyptian monasteries and intended for edification. Let us hope that it
served its end in its day. To us the dull, extravagant, and fantastic
Acts of the Saints, of which its original works chiefly consist, are
tedious and ridiculous except for the linguist or the church
historian. They certainly display the adjustment of the Ancient
Egyptian mind to new conditions of life and belief; but the
introduction of Christianity forms a fitting boundary to our sketch,
and we will now proceed to the texts themselves.</p>

<h3><a name="SAILOR" id="SAILOR"></a>THE SHIPWRECKED SAILOR</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[One of the most complete documents existing on papyrus is the 'Story
of the Shipwrecked Sailor.' The tale itself seems to date from a very
early period, when imagination could still have full play in Upper
Nubia. In it a sailor is apparently presenting a petition to some
great man, in hopes of royal favor as the hero of the marvels which he
proceeds to recount.</p>

<p>The Papyrus, which apparently is of the age of the XIth Dynasty, is
preserved at St. Petersburg, but is still unpublished. It has been
translated by Professors Golenisheff and Maspero. The present version
is taken from 'Egyptian Tales,' by W. M. Flinders Petrie.]</p></div>

<p>The wise servant said, "Let thy heart be satisfied, O my lord,
for that we have come back to the country; after we have
long been on board, and rowed much, the prow has at last
touched land. All the people rejoice and embrace us one after
another. Moreover, we have come back in good health, and not
a man is lacking; although we have been to the ends of Wawat<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and gone through the land of Senmut,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> we have returned in
peace, and our land&mdash;behold, we have come back to it. Hear
me, my lord; I have no other refuge. Wash thee and turn the
water over thy fingers, then go and tell the tale to the Majesty."</p>

<p>His lord replied, "Thy heart continues still its wandering
words! But although the mouth of a man may save him, his
words may also cover his face with confusion. Wilt thou do,
then, as thy heart moves thee. This that thou wilt say, tell
quietly."</p>

<p>The sailor then answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I shall tell that which has happened to me, to my very
self. I was going to the mines of Pharaoh, and I went down
on the Sea<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
on a ship of 150 cubits long and 40 cubits wide,
with 150 sailors of the best of Egypt, who had seen heaven and
earth, and whose hearts were stronger than lions. They had said
that the wind would not be contrary, or that there would be
none. But as we approached the land the wind arose, and threw
up waves eight cubits high. As for me, I sized a piece of wood;
but those who were in the vessel perished, without one remaining.
A wave threw me on an island, after that I had been three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5234" id="Page_5234">[Pg 5234]</a></span>
days alone, without a companion beside my own heart. I laid me
in a thicket and the shadow covered me. Then stretched I my
limbs to try to find something for my mouth. I found there figs
and grapes, all manner of good herbs, berries and grain, melons
of all kinds, fishes and birds. Nothing was lacking. And I satisfied
myself, and left on the ground that which was over, of what
my arms had been filled withal. I dug a pit, I lighted a fire, and
I made a burnt-offering unto the gods.</p>

<p>"Suddenly I heard a noise as of thunder, which I thought to
be that of a wave of the sea. The trees shook and the earth
was moved. I uncovered my face, and I saw that a serpent drew
near. He was thirty cubits long, and his beard greater than two
cubits; his body was overlaid with gold, and his color as that
of true lazuli. He coiled himself before me.</p>

<p>"Then he opened his mouth, while that I lay on my face
before him, and he said to me, 'What has brought thee, what
has brought thee, little one, what has brought thee? If thou
sayest not speedily what has brought thee to this isle, I will
make thee know thyself; as a flame thou shalt vanish, if thou
tellest me not something I have not heard, or which I knew not
before thee.'</p>

<p>"Then he took me in his mouth and carried me to his resting-place, and
laid me down without any hurt. I was whole and sound, and nothing was
gone from me. Then he opened his mouth against me, while that I lay on
my face before him, and he said, 'What has brought thee, what has
brought thee, little one, what has brought thee to this isle which is
in the sea, and of which the shores are in the midst of the waves?'</p>

<p>"Then I replied to him, and holding my arms low before
him,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
I said to him:&mdash;'I was embarked for the mines by the order of the Majesty,
in a ship; 150 cubits was its length, and the width of it 40 cubits. It
had 150 sailors of the best of Egypt, who had seen heaven and earth,
and the hearts of whom were stronger than lions. They said that the
wind would not be contrary, or that there would be none. Each of them
exceeded his companion in the prudence of his heart and the strength
of his arm, and I was not beneath any of them. A storm came upon us
while we were on the sea. Hardly could we reach to the shore when the
wind waxed yet greater, and the waves rose even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5235" id="Page_5235">[Pg 5235]</a></span>
eight cubits. As for me, I seized a piece of wood, while those who
were in the boat perished without one being left with me for three
days. Behold me now before thee, for I was brought to this isle by a
wave of the sea!"</p>

<p>"Then said he to me, 'Fear not, fear not, little one, and
make not thy face sad. If thou hast come to me, it is
God<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
who has let thee live. For it is he who has brought thee to this isle
of the blest, where nothing is lacking, and which is filled with
all good things. See now thou shalt pass one month after
another, until thou shalt be four months in this isle. Then a
ship shall come from thy land with sailors, and thou shalt leave
with them and go to thy country, and thou shalt die in thy town.
Converse is pleasing, and he who tastes of it passes over his
misery. I will therefore tell thee of that which is in this isle.
I am here with my brethren and my children around me; we are
seventy-five serpents, children, and kindred; without naming a
young girl who was brought unto me by chance, and on whom
the fire of heaven fell and burnt her to ashes. As for thee, if
thou art strong, and if thy heart waits patiently, thou shalt press
thy infants to thy bosom and embrace thy wife. Thou shalt
return to thy house which is full of all good things, thou shalt
see thy land, where thou shalt dwell in the midst of thy kindred!'</p>

<p>"Then I bowed in my obeisance, and I touched the ground
before him. 'Behold now that which I have told thee before. I
shall tell of thy presence unto Pharaoh, I shall make him to
know of thy greatness, and I will bring to thee of the sacred
oils and perfumes, and of incense of the temples with which all
gods are honored. I shall tell moreover of that which I do
now see (thanks to him), and there shall be rendered to thee
praises before the fullness of all the land. I shall slay asses for
thee in sacrifice, I shall pluck for thee the birds, and I shall
bring for thee ships full of all kinds of the treasures of Egypt,
as is comely to do unto a god, a friend of men in a far country,
of which men know not.'</p>

<p>"Then he smiled at my speech, because of that which was in
his heart, for he said to me, 'Thou art not rich in perfumes,
for all that thou hast is but common incense. As for me, I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5236" id="Page_5236">[Pg 5236]</a></span>
prince of the land of Punt,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and I have perfumes. Only the oil which thou saidst thou wouldst bring
is not common in this isle. But when thou shalt depart from this
place, thou shalt never more see this isle; it shall be changed into
waves.'</p>

<p>"And behold, when the ship drew near, attending to all that
he had told me before, I got me up into an high tree, to strive
to see those who were within it. Then I came and told to him
this matter; but it was already known unto him before. Then
he said to me, 'Farewell, farewell; go to thy house, little one,
see again thy children, and let thy name be good in thy town;
these are my wishes for thee!'</p>

<p>"Then I bowed myself before him, and held my arms low
before him, and he, he gave me gifts of precious perfumes, of
cassia, of sweet woods, of kohl, of cypress, an abundance of
incense, of ivory tusks, of baboons, of apes, and all kinds of
precious things. I embarked all in the ship which was come,
and bowing myself, I prayed God for him.</p>

<p>"Then he said to me, 'Behold, thou shalt come to thy country
in two months, thou shalt press to thy bosom thy children, and
thou shalt rest in thy tomb!' After this I went down to the
shore unto the ship, and I called to the sailors who were there.
Then on the shore I rendered adoration to the master of this
isle and to those who dwelt therein.</p>

<p>"When we shall come, in our return, to the house of Pharaoh, in the
second month, according to all that the serpent has said, we shall
approach unto the palace. And I shall go in before Pharaoh, I shall
bring the gifts which I have brought from this isle into the country.
Then he shall thank me before the fullness of all the land. Grant then
unto me a follower, and lead me to the courtiers of the king. Cast
thine eye upon me after that I am come to land again, after that I
have both seen and proved this. Hear my prayer, for it is good to
listen to people. It was said unto me, 'Become a wise man, and thou
shalt come to honor,' and behold I have become such."</p>

<p><i>This is finished from its beginning unto its end, even as it was
found in a writing. It is written by the scribe of cunning fingers,
Ameniamenaa; may he live in life, wealth, and health.</i></p>

<h3><a name="THE_STORY_OF_SANEHAT" id="THE_STORY_OF_SANEHAT"></a>THE STORY OF SANEHAT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The story of Sanehat is practically complete. A papyrus at Berlin
contains all the text except about twenty lines at the beginning, the
whole being written in about three hundred and thirty short lines.
Scraps of the missing portion were found in the collection of Lord
Amherst of Hackney; and these, added to a complete but very corrupt
text of about the first fifty lines, enable one to restore the whole
with tolerable certainty. The story was written about the time of the
XIIth or XIIIth Dynasty, but was known at a much later period: one
extract from the beginning of the tale and one from the end have been
found written in ink on limestone flakes or "ostraca" of about the
XXth Dynasty (about 1150 B.C.). It seems to be a straightforward
relation of actual occurrences, a real piece of biography. At any
rate, it is most instructive as showing the kind of intercourse that
was possible between Egypt and Palestine about 2500 B.C.]</p></div>


<p>The hereditary prince, royal seal-bearer, trusty companion,
judge, keeper of the gate of the foreigners, true and
beloved royal acquaintance, the attendant Sanehat says:&mdash;</p>

<p>I attended my lord as a servant of the king, of the household
of the hereditary princess, the greatly favored, the royal
wife, Ankhet-Usertesen [?], holding a place at Kanefer, the pyramid
of King Amenemhat.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In the thirtieth year, the month Paophi, the seventh day, the
god<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> entered his horizon, the King Sehetepabra flew up to heaven;
he joined the sun's disk, he attended the god, he joined his
Maker. The Residence<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> was silenced, the hearts were weakened,
the Great Portals were closed, the courtiers crouching on the
ground, the people in hushed mourning.</p>

<p>Now his Majesty had sent a great army with the nobles to
the land of the Temehu,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> his son and heir as their commander,
the good King Usertesen.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> And now he was returning, and had
brought away captives and all kinds of cattle without end. The
Companions of the Court sent to the West Side<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to let the king
know the state of affairs that had come about in the Audience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5238" id="Page_5238">[Pg 5238]</a></span>
Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The messenger found him on the road; he reached
him at the time of evening. "It was a time for him to hasten
greatly [was the message]: Let the Hawk<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> fly [hither] with his
attendants, without allowing the army to know of it." And when
the royal sons who commanded in that army sent messages, not
one of them was summoned to audience. Behold, I was standing
[near]; I heard his voice while he was speaking.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> I fled far away,
my heart beating, my arms outspread; trembling had fallen on
all my limbs. I ran hither and thither<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> to seek a place to hide
me, I threw myself amongst the bushes: and when I found a
road that went forward, I set out southward, not indeed thinking
to come to this Residence.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I expected that there would be disturbance.
I spake not of life after it.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> I wandered across my
estate<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> [?] in the neighborhood of Nehat; I reached the island [or
lake] of Seneferu, and spent the day [resting?] on the open field.
I started again while it was yet day,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and came to a man standing
at the side of the road. He asked of me mercy, for he
feared me. By supper-time I drew near to the town of Negau.
I crossed the river on a raft without a rudder, by the aid of a
west wind, and landed at the quay [?] of the quarrymen of the
Mistress at the Red Mountain.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Then I fled on foot northward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5239" id="Page_5239">[Pg 5239]</a></span>
and reached the Walls of the Ruler, built to repel the Sati.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I
crouched in a bush for fear, seeing the day-patrol at its duty on
the top of the fortress. At nightfall I set forth, and at dawn
reached Peten, and skirted the lake of Kemur.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Then thirst
hasted me on; I was parched, my throat was stopped, and I said,
"This is the taste of death." When I lifted up my heart and
gathered strength, I heard a voice and the lowing of cattle. I
saw men of the Sati; and an alien amongst them&mdash;he who is
[now?] in Egypt<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;recognized me. Behold, he gave me water,
and boiled me milk, and I went with him to his camp,&mdash;may a
blessing be their portion! One tribe passed me on to another: I
departed to Sun [?], and came to Kedem.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>There I spent a year and a month [?]. But Ammui-nen-sha,
Ruler of the Upper Tenu,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> took me and said to me:&mdash;"Comfort
thyself with me, that thou mayest hear the speech of Egypt."
He said thus, for that he knew my character, and had heard of
my worth; for men of Egypt who were there with him bore
witness of me. Then he said to me:&mdash;"For what hast thou come
hither? what is it? Hath a matter come to pass in the Residence?
The King of the Two Lands, Sehetepabra, hath gone to
heaven, and one knoweth not what may have happened thereon."
But I answered with concealment and said:&mdash;"I returned with
an expedition from the land of the Temehu; my desire was
redoubled, my heart leaped, there was no satisfaction within me.
This drove me to the ways of a fugitive. I have not failed in
my duty, my mouth hath not uttered any bitter words, I have
not hearkened to any evil plot, my name hath not been heard in
the mouth of the informer. I know not what hath brought me
into this country." [And the Ruler Ammui-nen-sha said:]<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> "This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5240" id="Page_5240">[Pg 5240]</a></span>
is like the disposition of God. And now what is that land like if
it know not that excellent god,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> of whom the dread was over the
nations like Sekhemt<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in a year of pestilence?" I spake [thus]
to him, and replied to him:&mdash;"Nay, but his son hath entered the
palace, and taken the heritage of his father, and he is a god
without an equal, nor was there any other before him [like unto
him]. He is a master of wisdom, prudent in his designs, excellent
in his decrees; coming out and going in is at his command.
It was he that curbed the nations while his father remained within
the palace, and he reported the execution of that which was laid
upon him [to perform]. He is a mighty man also, working with
his strong arm; a valiant one, who hath not his equal. See him
when he springeth upon the barbarians, and throweth himself on
the spoilers; he breaketh the horns and weakeneth the hands; his
enemies cannot wield their weapons.  He is fearless and dasheth
heads to pieces; none can stand before him. He is swift of going,
to destroy him who fleeth; and none turning his back to him
reacheth his home.  He is sturdy of heart in the moment [of
stress]; he is a lion that striketh with the claw; never hath he
turned his back. He is stout of heart when he seeth multitudes,
he letteth none repose beyond what his desire would spare. He
is bold of face when he seeth hesitation: his joy is to fall on the
barbarians. He seizeth the buckler, and leapeth forward; he repeateth
not his stroke, he slayeth, and none can turn his lance;
without his bow being drawn the barbarians flee from his arms
like dogs; for the great goddess hath granted him to war against
those who know not his name; he is thorough, he spareth not
and leaveth naught behind. He is full of grace and sweetness, a
love-winner; his city loveth him more than itself, it rejoiceth in
him more than in its own god; men and women go their ways,
calling their children by his name.  For he is a king that took
the kingdom while he was in the egg, and ruled from his birth.
He is a multiplier of offspring. And he is One Alone, the essence
of God; this land rejoiceth in his government. He is one that
enlargeth his borders; he will take the lands of the South, but he
will not design to hold the countries of the North: yet he prepareth
to smite the Sati, to crush the Wanderers of the Sand.
When he cometh here, let him know thy name; dispute not, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5241" id="Page_5241">[Pg 5241]</a></span>
go over to his command<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>: for he will not fail to treat well the
country that floateth with his stream."</p>

<p>Said he, agreeing to me:&mdash;"Verily, Egypt is excellent in its
stream<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> beyond anything, and it flourisheth; behold, as long as
thou art with me I will do good unto thee." He placed me at
the head of his children, he married me with his eldest daughter.
He allowed me to choose for myself from his land, and from the
choicest of what he possessed on the border of the next land. It
was a goodly land; Iaa<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> is its name. Therein were figs and
grapes; its wine was more plentiful than water; abundant was
its honey, many were its oil-trees, and all fruits were upon its
trees; there too was barley and spelt, and cattle of all kinds without
end. Great honors also were granted to me, flowing from
his love to me; he set me as sheikh of a tribe in a choice portion
of his country. There were made for me rations of bread, wine
from day to day, cooked meat and roasted fowl, besides wild game
snared for me or brought to me, as well as what my hunting
dogs caught. They made me many dainties, and milk food
cooked in all manner of ways. Thus I passed many years; my
children became valiant men, each one the conqueror of a tribe.
When a messenger came north or went south to the Residence,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
he tarried with me; for I gave all men gifts; I gave water to
the thirsty, I set the strayed wanderer on his road, and I
rescued those who were carried off captive. The Sati who went
to war or to repel the kings of the nations, I commanded their
expeditions; for this Ruler of the Tenu made me to spend
many years as captain of his army. Every land to which I
turned I overcame. I destroyed its green fields and its wells, I
captured its cattle, I took captive its inhabitants, I deprived
them of their provisions, and I slew much people of them by
my sword, my bow, my marchings, and my good devices. Thus
my excellence was in his heart; he loved me and he knew my
valor; until he set me at the head of his sons, when he saw the
success of my handiwork.</p>

<p>There came a champion of the Tenu to defy me in my tent;
a bold man without equal, for he had vanquished all his rivals.
He said, "Let Sanehat fight with me." He thought to overcome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5242" id="Page_5242">[Pg 5242]</a></span>
me; he designed to take my cattle, being thus counseled by his
tribe. This ruler [Ammui-nen-sha] conferred with me. I said:&mdash;"I
know him not. I assuredly am no associate of his; I hold me
far from his place. Have I ever opened his door, or leaped over
his fence? It is perverseness of heart from seeing me doing his
work. Forsooth, I am as it were a stranger bull among the cows,
which the bull of the herd charges, and the strong bull catches!
But shall a wretched beggar desire to attain to my fortune? A
common soldier cannot take part as a counselor. Then what
pray shall establish the assembly?<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> But is there a bull that
loveth battle, a courageous bull that loveth to repeat the charge
in terrifying him whose strength he hath measured? If he hath
stomach to fight, let him speak what he pleaseth. Will God forget
what is ordained for him? How shall fate be known?" The
night long I strung my bow, I made ready my arrows; I made
keen my dagger, I furbished my arms. At daybreak the Tenu
came together; it had gathered its tribes and collected the neighboring
peoples. Its thoughts were on this combat; every bosom
burned for me, men and women crying out; every heart was
troubled for me; they said, "Is there yet another champion
to fight with him?" Then [he took] his buckler, his battle-axe,
and an armful of javelins. But thereon I avoided his weapons,
and turned aside his arrows to the ground, useless. One drew
near to the other and he rushed upon me. I shot at him and my
arrow stuck in his neck; he cried out, and fell upon his nose: I
brought down upon him his own battle-axe, and raised my shout
of victory on his back. All the Asiatics roared, and I and his
vassals whom he had oppressed gave thanks unto Mentu; this
Ruler, Ammui-nen-sha, took me to his embrace. Then I took
his goods, I seized his cattle. What he had thought to do to
me, I did it unto him; I seized that which was in his tent, I
spoiled his dwelling. I grew great thereby, I increased in my
possessions. I abounded in cattle.</p>

<p>"May<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the god be disposed to pardon him in whom he had
trusted, and who deserted to a foreign country. Now is his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5243" id="Page_5243">[Pg 5243]</a></span>
anger quenched. I who at one time fled away a fugitive, my
guarantee is now in the Residence. Having wandered a starved
wanderer, now I give bread to those around. Having left my
land in rags, now I shine in fine linen. Having been a fugitive
without followers, now I possess many serfs. My house is
fair, my dwelling large, I am spoken of in the palace. All the
gods destined me this flight. Mayest thou be gracious; may I be
restored to the Residence; favor me that I may see the place in
which my heart dwelleth. Behold how great a thing is it that
my body should be embalmed in the land where I was born!
Come; if afterwards there be good fortune, I will give an offering
to God that he may work to make good the end of his suppliant,
whose heart is heavy at long absence in a strange land.
May he be gracious; may he hear the prayer of him who is afar
off, that he may revisit the place of his birth, and the place
from which he removed.</p>

<p>"May the King of Egypt be gracious to me, by whose favor
men live. I salute the mistress of the land, who is in his palace;
may I hear the news of her children, and may my body renew
its vigor thereby. But old age cometh, weakness hasteneth me
on, the eyes are heavy, my arms are failing, my feet have
ceased to follow the heart. Weariness of going on approacheth
me; may they convey me to the cities of eternity. May I serve
the mistress of all.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Oh that she may tell me the beauties of her
children; may she bring eternity to me."</p>

<p>Now the Majesty of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt,
Kheper-ka-ra, justified, spake concerning this condition in which
I was. His Majesty sent unto me with presents from before the
king, that he might make glad the heart of your servant,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> as he
would unto the Ruler of any country; and the royal sons who
were in his palace caused me to hear their news.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5244" id="Page_5244">[Pg 5244]</a></span>"Behold,
this command of the king is sent to thee to give thee
information: Whereas thou didst go round strange lands from
Kedem<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to Tenu, one country passed thee on to another as thy
heart devised for thee. Behold, what thou hast done hath been
done unto thee: Thou hast not blasphemed, so also the accusation
against thee hath been repelled. So also thy sayings have
been respected; thou hast not spoken against the Council of the
Nobles. But this matter carried away thy heart; it was not
[devised] in thy heart.</p>

<p>"Leave the riches that thou hast, and in the abundance of
which thou livest. When thou comest to Egypt thou shalt
visit the Residence in which thou wast, thou shalt kiss the
ground before the Great Portals, thou shalt assume authority
amongst the Companions. But day by day, behold, thou growest
old; thy vigor is lost; thou thinkest on thy day of burial. Thou
shalt be conducted to the blessed state; there shall be assigned
to thee a night of sacred oils and wrappings from the hands of
the goddess Tayt. There shall be held for thee a procession [behind
thy statues] and a visit [to the temple] on the day of burial,
the mummy case gilded, the head blue, the canopy above thee;
the putting in the skin-frame, oxen to draw thee, singers going
before thee, the answering chant, and mourners crouching at the
door of thy tomb-chapel. Prayers for offerings shall be recited
for thee, victims shall be slaughtered at the door portrayed upon
thy tablet<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>; and thy mastaba shall be built of white stone, in the
company of the royal children. Thou shalt not die in a strange
land, nor be buried by the Amu; thou shalt not be put in a
sheepskin, thou shalt be well regarded. It is vain [?] to beat
the ground and think on troubles.</p>

this order came to me, I stood in the midst of my
tribe, and when it was read unto me, I threw me on my belly; I
bowed to the ground and let the dust spread upon my breast. I
strode around my tent rejoicing and saying:&mdash;"How is this done
to the servant, whose heart had transgressed to a strange country
of babbling tongue? But verily good is compassion, that I should
be saved from death. Thy <i>Ka</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> it is that will cause me to pass
the end of my days in the Residence."</p>

<h4><i>Copy of the acknowledgment of this command.</i></h4>

<p>"The servant of the royal house [?], Sanehat, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In most excellent peace! Known is it to thy <i>Ka</i> that this
flight of thy servant was made in innocence. Thou the Good
God, Lord of both Lands, Beloved of Ra, Favored of Mentu,
lord of Uast, and of Amen, lord of the Thrones of the Two
Lands, of Sebek, Ra, Horus, Hathor, Atmu and his Ennead, of
Sepdu, Neferbiu, Semsetu, Horus of the east, and of the Mistress
of the Cave<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> who resteth on thy head, of the chief circle of the

thee eternity without end, everlastingness without bound. May
the fear of thee be doubled in the lands and in the foreign countries,
mayest thou subdue the circuit of the sun. This is the
prayer of the servant for his master, who hath delivered him
from Amenti.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>"The possessor of understanding understandeth the higher
order of men, and the servant recognizeth the majesty of
Pharaoh. But thy servant feareth to speak it: it is a weighty
matter to tell of. The great God, like unto Ra, knoweth well
the work which he himself hath wrought. Who is thy servant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5246" id="Page_5246">[Pg 5246]</a></span>
that he should be considered, that words should be spent upon
him? Thy majesty is as Horus, and the strength of thy arms
extendeth to all lands.</p>

<p>"Then let his Majesty command that there be brought to
him Meki of Kedem, Khentiu-aaush of Khent-keshu, and Menus
of the Two Lands of the Fenkhu; these are chiefs as hostages
that the Tenu act according to the desire of thy <i>Ka</i>, and that
Tenu will not covet what belongeth to thee in it, like thy
dogs.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Behold this flight that thy servant made: I did not desire
it, it was not in my heart; I do not boast of it; I know not what
took me away from my place; it was like the leading of a
dream, as a man of Adhu sees himself in Abu,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> as a man of the

fear, none was hastening in pursuit of me; I did not listen to an
evil plot, my name was not heard in the mouth of the informer;
but my limbs went, my feet wandered, my heart drew me; a
god ordained this flight, and led me on. But I am not stiff-necked;
a man feareth if he knoweth [?], for Ra hath spread thy
fear over the land, thy terrors in every foreign country. Behold
me in thy palace or behold me in this place,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> still thou art he
who doth clothe this horizon. The sun riseth at thy pleasure,
the water in the rivers is drunk at thy will, the wind in heaven
is breathed at thy saying.</p>

<p>"Thy servant will leave to a successor the viziership which thy
servant hath held in this land. And when thy servant shall arrive<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
let thy Majesty do as pleaseth him, for one liveth by the
breath that thou givest. O thou who art beloved of Ra, of
Horus, and of Hathor! It is thy august nostril that Mentu, lord
of Uast, desireth should live for ever."</p>

<p>It was granted that I should spend a day in Iaa,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> to pass over
my goods to my children, my eldest son leading my tribe, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5247" id="Page_5247">[Pg 5247]</a></span>
all my goods in his hand, my people and all my cattle, my fruit,
and all my pleasant trees. When thy humble servant<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> journeyed
to the south, and arrived at the Roads of Horus, the officer who
was over the frontier-patrol sent a report to the Residence to
give notice. His Majesty sent the good overseer of the peasants
of the king's domains, and ships with him laden with presents
from the king for the Sati who had come with me to convey me
to the Roads of Horus. I spoke to each one by his name, each
officer according to his rank. I received and I returned the salutation,
and I continued thus<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> until I reached Athtu.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>When the land was lightened, and the second day came,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
there came some to summon me, four men in coming, four
men in going,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> to carry [?] me to the palace. I alighted on the
ground between the gates of reception [?]; the royal children
stood at the platform to greet [?] me; the Companions and those
who ushered to the hall brought me on the way to the royal
chamber.</p>

<p>I found his Majesty on the great throne on a platform of pale
gold. Then I threw myself on my belly; this god, in whose
presence I was, knew me not while he questioned me graciously;
but I was as one caught in the night; my spirit fainted, my
limbs shook, my heart was no longer in my bosom, and I knew
the difference between life and death. His Majesty said to one
of the Companions, "Lift him up; let him speak to me." And
his Majesty said:&mdash;"Behold, thou hast come; thou hast trodden the
deserts; thou hast played the wanderer. Decay falleth on thee,
old age hath reached thee; it is no small thing that thy body
should be embalmed, that thou shalt not be buried by foreign
soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Do not, do not, be silent and speechless; tell thy
name; is it fear that preventeth thee?" I answered with the
answer of one terrified, "What is it that my lord hath said? O
that I might answer it! It was not my act: it was the hand of
God; it was a terror that was in my body, as it were causing a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5248" id="Page_5248">[Pg 5248]</a></span>
flight that had been foreordained. Behold I am before thee, thou
art life; let thy Majesty do what pleaseth him."</p>

<p>The royal children were brought in, and his Majesty said to
the queen, "Behold thou, Sanehat hath come as an Amu, whom
the Sati have produced."</p>

<p>She shrieked aloud, and the royal children joined in one cry,
and said before his Majesty, "Verily it is not he, O king, my
lord." Said his Majesty, "It is verily he." Then they brought
their tinkling bead-strings, their wands, and their sistra in their
hands, and waved them<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> before his Majesty [and they sang]:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Said his Majesty:&mdash;"He shall not fear; let him be freed from
terror. He shall be a Companion amongst the nobles; he shall
be put within the circle of the courtiers. Go ye to the chamber
of praise to seek wealth for him."</p>

<p>When I went out from the Audience Chamber, the royal
children offered their hands to me; and we walked afterwards to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5249" id="Page_5249">[Pg 5249]</a></span>
the Great Portals. I was placed in a house of a king's son, in
which were fine things; there was a cool bower therein, fruits of
the granary, treasures of the White House,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> clothes of the king's
guard-robe, frankincense, the finest perfumes of the king and the
nobles whom he loves, in every chamber; and every kind of
servitor in his proper office. Years were removed from my
limbs: I was shaved, and my locks of hair were combed; the
foulness was cast to the desert, with the garments of the Nemausha.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
I clothed me in fine linen, and anointed myself with the
best oil; I laid me on a bed. I gave up the sand to those who
lie on it; the oil of wood to him who would anoint himself
therewith.</p>

<p>There was given to me the house of Neb-mer [?], which had
belonged to a Companion. There were many craftsmen building
it; all its woodwork was strengthened anew. Portions were
brought to me from the palace thrice and four times a day,
besides the gifts of the royal children; there was not a moment's
ceasing from them. There was built for me a pyramid of stone
amongst the pyramids. The overseer of the architects measured
its ground; the chief treasurer drew it; the sacred masons did
the sculpture; the chief of the laborers in the necropolis brought
the bricks; and all the instruments applied to a tomb were there
employed. There were given to me fields; there was made for
me a necropolis garden, the land in it better than a farm estate;
even as is done for the chief Companion. My statue was overlaid
with gold, its girdle with pale gold; his Majesty caused it to
be made. Such is not done to a man of low degree.</p>

<p>Thus am I in the favor of the king until the day of death
shall come.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DOOMED_PRINCE" id="THE_DOOMED_PRINCE"></a>THE DOOMED PRINCE</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>['The Story of the Doomed Prince' was written at some time during the
XVIIIth Dynasty (about 1450 B.C.). The papyrus on which it has been preserved
to us, and which is in the British Museum, is much mutilated, and the
end is entirely lost.]</p></div>

<p>There was once a king to whom no male child was born; he
prayed for himself unto the gods whom he worshiped for
a son. They decreed to cause that there should be born
to him one. And his wife, after her time was fulfilled, gave
birth to a male child. Came the Hathors<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
to decree for him a destiny; they said, "He dies by the crocodile, or by
the serpent, or by the dog." Then the people who stood by the child heard
this; they went to tell it to his Majesty. Then his Majesty's
heart was exceeding sad. His Majesty caused a house to be
built upon the desert, furnished with people and with all good
things of the royal house, out of which the child should not go.
Now when the child was grown he went up upon its roof and
saw a greyhound; it was following a man walking on the road.
He said to his page who was with him, "What is this that goeth
behind the man coming along the road?" He said to him, "It
is a greyhound." The child said to him, "Let there be brought
to me one like it." The page went and reported it to his
Majesty. His Majesty said, "Let there be brought to him a little
trotter, lest his heart be sad." Then they brought to him the
greyhound.</p>

<p>Now when the days were multiplied after these things, the
child grew up in all his limbs, he sent a message to his father
saying, "Wherefore should I remain here? Behold, I am destined
to three dooms, and if I do according to my desire God will still
do what is in his heart." They hearkened to all he said, and
gave him all kinds of weapons, and also his greyhound to follow
him, and they conveyed him over to the east side and said
to him, "Go thou whither thou wilt." His greyhound was
with him; he traveled northward following his heart in the desert;
he lived on the best of all the game of the desert. He came to
the chief of Naharaina.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5251" id="Page_5251">[Pg 5251]</a></span>
Behold, there was no child born to the prince of Naharaina except one
daughter. Behold, he built for her a house; its window was seventy
cubits from the ground, and he caused to be brought all the sons of
all the chiefs of the land of Kharu,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
and said to them, "He who shall reach the window of my daughter, she
shall be to him for a wife."</p>

<p>Now when the days had multiplied after these things, as they were in
their daily task, the youth came by them. They took the youth to their
house, they bathed him, they gave provender to his horse, they did
every kind of thing for the youth; they anointed him, they bound up
his feet, they gave him portions of their own food; they spake to him
in the manner of conversation, "Whence comest thou, good youth?" He
said to them:&mdash;"I am the son of an officer of the land of Egypt; my
mother is dead, my father has taken another wife. When she bore
children, she began to hate me, and I have come as a fugitive from
before her." They embraced him and kissed him.</p>

<p>Now when the days were multiplied after these things, he said to the
youths, "What is it that ye do here?" And they said to him, "We spend
our time in this: we climb up, and he who shall reach the window of
the daughter of the prince of Naharaina, to him she will be given to
wife." He said to them, "Lo! I desire to try, I shall go to climb with
you." They went to climb, as was their daily wont: the youth stood
afar off to behold; and the face of the daughter of the prince of
Naharaina was turned to him. Now when the days were multiplied after
these things, the youth came to climb with the sons of the chiefs. He
climbed, he reached the window of the daughter of the prince of
Naharaina. She kissed him, she embraced him.</p>

<p>One went to rejoice the heart of her father, and said to him, "A man
has reached the window of thy daughter." The prince spake of it,
saying, "The son of which of the princes is it?" He said to him, "It
is the son of an officer, who has come as a fugitive from the land of
Egypt, fleeing from before his step-mother when she had children."
Then the prince of Naharaina was exceeding angry; he said, "Shall I
indeed give my daughter to the Egyptian fugitive? Let him go back."
One came to tell the youth, "Go back to the place from which thou hast
come." But the maiden took hold of him; she swore an oath by God,
saying, "By the life of Ra Harakhti, if one taketh him from me,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5252" id="Page_5252">[Pg 5252]</a></span>
I will not eat, I will not drink, I shall die in that same hour." The
messenger went to tell unto her father all that she said. Then the
prince sent men to slay him, while he was in his house. But the maiden
said, "By the life of Ra, if one slay him I shall be dead ere the sun
goeth down. I will not pass an hour of life if I am parted from him."
One went to tell her father. Then ... the prince came; he embraced
him, he kissed him all over, and said, "Tell me who thou art; behold,
thou art to me as a son." He said to him:&mdash;"I am a son of an officer
of the land of Egypt; my mother died, my father took to him a second
wife; she came to hate me, and I fled from before her." He gave to him
his daughter to wife; he gave also to him people and fields, also
cattle and all manner of good things.</p>

<p>Now when time had passed over these things, the youth said to his
wife, "I am destined to three dooms&mdash;a crocodile, a serpent, and a
dog." She said to him, "Let one kill the dog that runs before thee."
He said to her, "I will not let my dog be killed, which I have brought
up from when it was small." And she feared greatly for her husband,
and would not let him go alone abroad.</p>

<p>One did ... the land of Egypt, to travel. Behold, the crocodile, ...
he came opposite the city in which the youth was.... Behold, there was
a mighty man therein; the mighty man would not suffer the crocodile to
go out, ... the crocodile. The mighty man went out to walk when the
sun ... every day, during two months of days.</p>

<p>Now when the days passed after this, the youth sat making a good day
in his house. When the evening came he lay down on his bed; sleep
seized upon his limbs; his wife filled a bowl of milk and placed it by
his side. There came out a serpent from his hole, to bite the youth;
behold, his wife was sitting by him; she lay not down. Thereupon the
servants gave milk to the serpent; it drank and became drunk, and lay
down, upside down; his wife cut it in pieces with her hatchet. They
woke her husband ... she said to him, "Behold, thy god hath given one
of thy dooms into thy hand; he shall give...." And he sacrificed to
God, adoring him, and praising his mighty spirit from day to day.</p>

<p>Now when the days were multiplied after these things, the youth went
to walk in the pathway in his enclosure, for he went not outside
alone; behold, his dog was behind him. His dog put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5253" id="Page_5253">[Pg 5253]</a></span> his nose to the
ground [to pursue some game], and he ran after him. He came to the
sea, and entered the sea behind his dog. The crocodile came out, he
took him to the place where the mighty man was.... The crocodile, he
said to the youth, "I am thy doom, following after thee...."</p>

<p>Once there were two brothers, of one mother and one father; Anpu was
the name of the elder, and Bata was the name of the younger. Now, as
for Anpu, he had a house and he had a wife. His younger brother was to
him as it were a son; he it was who made for him his clothes, while he
walked behind his oxen to the fields; he it was who did the plowing;
he it was who harvested the corn; he it was who did for him all the
work of the fields. Behold, his younger brother grew to be an
excellent worker; there was not his equal in the whole land; behold,
the strain of a god was in him.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days multiplied after these things</i>, his younger brother
followed his oxen as his manner was, daily; every evening he turned
again to the house, laden with all the herbs of the field, with milk
and with wood, and with all things of the field. He put them down
before his elder brother, who was sitting with his wife; he drank and
ate; he lay down in his stable with the cattle.</p>

<p><i>Now when the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, he took bread
which he had baked, and laid it before his elder brother; and he took
with him his bread to the field, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5254" id="Page_5254">[Pg 5254]</a></span> drave his cattle to pasture
them in the fields. And he used to walk behind his cattle, they saying
to him, "Good is the herbage which is in such a place;" and he
hearkened to all that they said, and he took them to the good pasture
which they desired. And the cattle which were before him became
exceeding excellent, and they became prolific greatly.</p>

<p>Now at the time of plowing, his elder brother said unto him, "Let us
make ready for ourselves a yoke of oxen for plowing; for the land hath
come out from the water; it is good for plowing in this state; and do
thou come to the field with corn, for we will begin the plowing in the
morrow morning." Thus said he to him; <i>and his</i> younger brother did
everything that his elder brother had bidden him, to the end.</p>

<p><i>Now when the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, they went to the
fields with their yoke of oxen; and their hearts were pleased
exceedingly with that which they accomplished in the beginning of
their work.</p>

<p>N<i>ow when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, they were in
the field; they stopped for seed corn, and he sent his younger
brother, saying, "Haste thou, bring to us corn from the farm." And the
younger brother found the wife of his elder brother; [some] one was
sitting arranging her hair. He said to her [the wife], "Get up, and
give to me seed corn, that I may run to the field, for my elder
brother hastened me; be not slow." She said to him, "Go, open the
store, and thou shalt take for thyself what is in thy heart; do not
interrupt the course of my hair-dressing."</p>

<p>The youth went into his stable; he took a large measure, for he
desired to take much corn; he loaded it with barley and spelt; and he
went out carrying them. She said to him, "How much of the corn that is
wanted, is that which is on thy shoulder?" He said to her, "Three
bushels of spelt, and two of barley, in all five; these are what are
upon my shoulder;" thus said he to her. And she spake with him,
saying, "There is great strength in thee, for I see thy might every
day." And her desire was to know him with the knowledge of youth. She
arose and took hold of him, and said to him, "Come, lie with me;
behold, this shall be to thine advantage, for I will make for thee
beautiful garments." Then the youth became like a leopard of the south
in fury at the evil speech which she had made to him; and she feared
greatly. He spake with her, saying, "Behold, thou art to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5255" id="Page_5255">[Pg 5255]</a></span> me as a
mother; thy husband is to me as a father; for he who is elder than I
hath brought me up. What is this great wickedness that thou hast said?
Say it not to me again. For I will not tell it to any man, that it
should go forth by the mouth of all men." He lifted up his burden, and
he went to the field and came to his elder brother; and they took up
their work, to labor at their task.</p>

<p>Now afterwards, at the time of evening, his elder brother was
returning to his house; the younger brother was following after his
oxen; he loaded himself with all the things of the field; he brought
his oxen before him, to make them lie down in their stable which was
in the farm. Behold, the wife of the elder brother was afraid for the
words which she had said. She took a pot of fat; she made herself as
one who had been beaten by miscreants, in order that she might say to
her husband, "It is thy younger brother who hath done this wrong." Her
husband returned in the even, as his manner was every day; he came
unto his house; he found his wife lying down, ill of violence; she did
not put water upon his hands as his manner was; she did not make a
light before him; his house was in darkness, and she was lying
vomiting. Her husband said to her, "Who hath spoken with thee?"
Behold, she said, "No one hath spoken with me except thy younger
brother. When he came to take for thee seed corn he found me sitting
alone; he said to me, 'Come, let us lie together; put on thy wig<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>;'
thus spake he to me. I would not hearken to him: 'Behold, am I not thy
mother, is not thy elder brother to thee as a father?' Thus spake I to
him, and he feared, and he beat me to stop me from making report to
thee, and if thou lettest him live I shall kill myself. Now behold,
when he cometh to-morrow, seize upon him; I will accuse him of this
wicked thing which he would have done the day before."</p>

<p>The elder brother became as a leopard of the south; he sharpened his
knife; he took it in his hand; he stood behind the door of his stable
to slay his younger brother as he came in the evening to let his
cattle into the stable.</p>

<p>Now the sun went down, and he loaded himself with all the herbs of the field
in his manner of every day. He came; his leading cow entered the stable; she said
to her keeper, "Behold, thy elder brother is standing before thee with his knife to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5256" id="Page_5256">[Pg 5256]</a></span>
slay thee; flee from before him." He heard what his leading cow had
said; the next entered and said likewise. He looked beneath the door
of the stable; he saw the feet of his elder brother standing behind
the door with his knife in his hand. He put down his load on the
ground, he set out to flee swiftly; his elder brother pursued after
him with his knife. Then the younger brother cried out unto Ra
Harakhti, saying, "My good Lord! Thou art he who distinguishest wrong
from right." Ra hearkened to all his complaint; Ra caused to be made a
great water between him and his elder brother, full of crocodiles; the
one brother was on one bank, the other on the other bank; and the
elder brother smote twice on his hands at not slaying him. Thus did
he. The younger brother called to the elder on the bank, saying,
"Stand still until the dawn of day; when Ra ariseth I shall argue with
thee before him, and he giveth the wrong to the right. For I shall not
be with thee unto eternity. I shall not be in the place in which thou
art; I shall go to the Valley of the Acacia."</p>

<p><i>Now when the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, Ra
Harakhti<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
shone out, and each of them saw the other. The youth spake with his
elder brother, saying:&mdash;"Wherefore earnest thou after me to slay me
wrongfully, when thou hadst not heard my mouth speak? For I am thy
younger brother in truth; thou art to me as a father; thy wife is to
me even as a mother: is it not so? Verily, when I was sent to bring
for us seed corn, thy wife said to me, 'Come lie with me.' Behold,
this has been turned over to thee upside down." He caused him to
understand all that happened with him and his wife. He swore an oath
by Ra Harakhti, saying, "Thy coming to slay me wrongfully, having thy
spear, was the instigation of a wicked and filthy one." He took a reed
knife and mutilated himself; he cast the flesh into the water, and the
silurus swallowed it. He sank; he became faint; his elder brother
chided his heart greatly; he stood weeping for him loudly, that he
could not cross to where his younger brother was, because of the
crocodiles. The younger brother called unto him, saying, "Whereas thou
hast devised an evil thing, wilt thou not also devise a good thing, or
such a thing as I would do unto thee? When thou goest to thy house
thou must look to thy cattle; for I stay not in the place where thou
art, I am going to the Valley of the Acacia. Now as to what thou
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5257" id="Page_5257">[Pg 5257]</a></span>
shalt do for me: verily, understand this, that things shall happen
unto me; namely, that I shall draw out my soul, that I shall put it
upon the top of the flowers of the acacia; the acacia-tree will be cut
down, it shall fall to the ground, and thou shalt come to seek for it,
and if thou passest seven years searching for it, let not thy heart
sicken. Thou shalt find it; thou must put it in a cup of cold water
that I may live again, that I may make answer to what hath been done
wrong. Thou shalt understand this; namely, that things are happening
to me, when one shall give to thee a pot of beer in thy hand and it
shall foam up: stay not then, for verily it shall come to pass with
thee."</p>

<p>He went to the Valley of the Acacia; his elder brother went to his
house; his hand was laid on his head; he cast dust on his head; he
came to his house, he slew his wife, he cast her to the dogs, and he
sat in mourning for his younger brother.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, his younger
brother was in the Valley of the Acacia; there was none with him; he
spent the day hunting the game of the desert, he came back in the even
to lie down under the acacia, the top-most flower of which was his
soul.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, he built
himself a tower with his hand, in the Valley of the Acacia; it was
full of all good things, that he might provide for himself a home.</p>

<p>He went out from his tower, he met the Ennead of the
gods,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
who were going forth to arrange the affairs of their whole land. The Nine Gods
talked one with another, they said unto him: "Ho! Bata, Bull of the
Ennead of the gods, art thou remaining alone, having fled thy village
from before the wife of Anpu thy elder brother? Behold, his wife is
slain. Thou hast given him an answer to all that was transgressed
against thee." Their hearts were sad for him exceedingly. Ra Harakhti
said to Khnumu,<a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
"Behold, frame thou a wife for Bata, that he may not sit alone." Khnumu made
for him a mate to dwell with him. She was more beautiful in her limbs than
any woman who is in the whole land. Every god was in her. The seven Hathors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5258" id="Page_5258">[Pg 5258]</a></span>
came to see her: they said with one mouth, "She will die a sharp death."</p>

<p>He loved her very exceedingly, and she dwelt in his house; he passed
his time in hunting the game of the desert, and brought what he took
before her. He said, "Go not outside, lest the sea seize thee; for I
cannot rescue thee from it, for I am a woman like thee: my soul is
placed on the top of the flower of the acacia; and if another find it,
I shall be vanquished by him." He explained to her all about his soul.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, Bata went to
hunt as his daily manner was. The girl went to walk under the acacia
which was by the side of her house; the sea saw her, and cast its
waves up after her. She set out to run away from it; she entered her
house. The sea called unto the acacia, saying, "Oh, catch hold of her
for me!" The acacia brought a lock from her hair, the sea carried it
to Egypt, and dropped it in the place of the washers of Pharaoh's
linen. The smell of the lock of hair entered into the clothes of
Pharaoh. They were wroth with Pharaoh's washers, saying, "The smell of
ointment is in the clothes of Pharaoh." The men were rebuked every
day; they knew not what they should do. The chief of the washers of
Pharaoh went down to the seaside; his soul was black within him
because of the chiding with him daily. He stopped and stood upon the
sandy shore opposite to the lock of hair, which was in the water; he
made one go in, and it was brought to him; there was found in it a
smell, exceeding sweet. He took it to Pharaoh; the scribes and the
wise men were brought to Pharaoh; they said unto Pharaoh:&mdash;"This lock
of hair belongs to a daughter of Ra Harakhti; the strain of every god
is in her; it is a tribute to thee from a strange land. Let messengers
go to every foreign land to seek her: as for the messenger who shall
go to the Valley of the Acacia, let many men go with him to bring
her." Then said his Majesty, "Excellent exceedingly is what we have
said;" and the men were sent.</p>

<p><i>When the days were multiplied after these things</i>, the people who
went abroad came to give report unto the king: but there came not
those who went to the Valley of the Acacia, for Bata had slain them;
he spared one of them to give a report to the king. His Majesty sent
many men and soldiers as well as horsemen, to bring her back. There
was a woman among them, into whose hand was put every kind of
beautiful ornaments for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5259" id="Page_5259">[Pg 5259]</a></span> woman. The girl came back with her; there
were rejoicings for her in the whole land.</p>

<p>His Majesty loved her exceedingly, and raised her to be a princess of
high rank; he spake with her that she should tell concerning her
husband. She said to his Majesty, "Let the acacia be cut down, and let
one chop it up." They sent men and soldiers with their weapons to cut
down the acacia; they came to the acacia, they cut the flower upon
which was the soul of Bata, and he fell dead upon the instant.</p>

<p><i>Now when the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, the acacia was
cut down. And Anpu, the elder brother of Bata, entered his house; he
sat down and washed his hands: one gave him a pot of beer, it foamed
up; another was given him of wine, it became foul. He took his staff,
his sandals, likewise his clothes, with his weapons of war; he set out
to walk to the Valley of the Acacia. He entered the tower of his
younger brother; he found his younger brother lying on his bed; he was
dead. He wept when he saw his younger brother verily lying dead. He
went out to seek the soul of his younger brother under the acacia
tree, under which his younger brother used to lie in the evening. He
spent three years in seeking for it, but found it not. When he began
the fourth year, he desired in his heart to return into Egypt; he
said, "I will go to-morrow;" thus spake he in his heart.</p>

<p><i>When the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, he went out under
the acacia, and set to work to seek it again. He found a seed-pod. He
returned with it. Behold, this was the soul of his younger brother. He
brought a cup of cold water, he dropped it into it: he sat down, as
his manner of every day was. Now when the night came his [Bata's] soul
absorbed the water; Bata shuddered in all his limbs, he looked on his
elder brother; his soul was in the cup. Then Anpu took the cup of cold
water in which the soul of his younger brother was; he [Bata] drank
it, his soul stood again in its place, he became as he had been. They
embraced each other, and they spake with one another.</p>

<p>Bata said to his elder brother, "Behold, I am to become as a great
bull, with all the right markings; no one knoweth its history, and
thou must sit upon his back. When the sun arises we will go to that
place where my wife is, that I may return answer to her; and thou must
take me to the place where the king is. For all good things shall be
done for thee, and one shall lade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5260" id="Page_5260">[Pg 5260]</a></span> thee with silver and gold, because
thou bringest me to Pharaoh; for I become a great marvel, they shall
rejoice for me in all the land. And thou shalt go to thy village."</p>

<p><i>When the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, Bata became in the
form which he had told to his elder brother. And Anpu his elder
brother sat upon his back until the dawn. He came to the place where
the king was; they made his Majesty to know of him; he saw him, and he
rejoiced exceedingly. He made for him great offerings, saying, "This
is a great wonder which has come to pass." There were rejoicings over
him in the whole land. They loaded him with silver and gold for his
elder brother, who went and settled in his village. They gave to the
bull many men and many things, and Pharaoh loved him exceedingly above
all men that are in this land.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, the bull
entered the place of purifying; he stood in the place where the
princess was; he began to speak with her, saying, "Behold, I am alive
indeed." She said to him, "Who then art thou?" He said to her: "I am
Bata. Thou knewest well when thou causedst that they should cut down
the acacia for Pharaoh, that it was to my hurt, that I might not be
suffered to live. Behold, I am alive indeed, being as an ox." Then the
princess feared exceedingly for the words that her husband had spoken
to her. And he went out from the place of purifying.</p>

<p>His Majesty was sitting, making a good day with her: she was at the
table of his Majesty, and the king was exceeding pleased with her. She
said to his Majesty, "Swear to me by God, saying, 'What thou shalt
say, I will obey it for thy sake.'" He hearkened unto all that she
said. And she said, "Let me eat of the liver of this bull, because he
will do nothing;" thus spake she to him. He was exceedingly vexed at
that which she said, the heart of Pharaoh was grieved exceedingly.</p>

<p><i>Now when the earth lighted and the second day came</i>, there was
proclaimed a great feast with offerings to the ox. The king sent one
of the chief butchers of his Majesty, to have the ox sacrificed.
Afterwards it was caused to be sacrificed, and when it was in the
hands of the men, it shook its neck, and threw two drops of blood over
against the double door of his Majesty. One fell upon the one side of
the great door of Pharaoh, and the other upon the other side. They
grew as two great Persea trees; each of them was excellent.</p>

One went to tell unto his Majesty, "Two great Persea trees have grown,
as a great marvel for his Majesty, in the night, by the side of the
great gate of his Majesty." There was rejoicing for them in all the
land, and there were offerings made to them.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, his Majesty
was adorned with a blue crown, with garlands of flowers on his neck;
he was upon the chariot of electrum; he went out from the palace to
behold the Persea trees: the princess also went out with horses behind
Pharaoh. His Majesty sat beneath one of the Persea trees, and it spake
thus with his wife:&mdash;"Oh thou deceitful one, I am Bata; I am alive,
though I have suffered violence. Thou knewest well that the causing of
the acacia to be cut down for Pharaoh was to my hurt. I then became an
ox, and thou hadst me slain."</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, the princess
stood at the table of Pharaoh, and the king was pleased with her. She
said to his Majesty, "Swear to me by God, saying, 'That which the
princess shall say to me I will obey it for her.' Thus do thou." And
he hearkened unto all that she said. She said, "Let these two Persea
trees be cut down, and let them be made into goodly timber." He
hearkened unto all that she said.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, his
Majesty sent skillful craftsmen, and they cut down the Persea trees of
Pharaoh, while the princess, the royal wife, stood by and saw it. A
chip flew up and entered into the mouth of the princess; and she
perceived that she had conceived, and while her days were being
fulfilled Pharaoh did all that was in her heart
therein.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, she bore a
male child. One went to tell his Majesty, "There is born to thee a
son." They brought him [<i>i. e.</i>, the child, to the king], and gave to
him a nurse and servants; there were rejoicings in the whole land. The
king sat making a good day; they performed the naming of him, his
Majesty loved him exceedingly on the instant, the king raised him to
be the royal son of Kush.</p>

<p><i>Now when the days were multiplied after these things</i>, his Majesty
made him heir of all the land.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_STORY_OF_SETNA" id="THE_STORY_OF_SETNA"></a>THE STORY OF SETNA</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The beginning of this tale is lost, but it is clear from what remains
of it that Setna Kha-em-uast, son of a Pharaoh who may be identified
with Rameses II., of the XIXth Dynasty (about 1300 B.C.), was a
diligent student of the ancient writings, chiefly for the sake of the
occult knowledge which they were supposed to contain. He discovered,
or was told of, the existence of a book which Thoth, the god of
letters, science and magic, had "written with his own hand," and
learned that this book was to be found in the cemetery of Memphis, in
the tomb of Na-nefer-ka-ptah, the only son of some earlier Pharaoh.
Setna evidently succeeded in finding and entering this tomb, and there
he saw the <i>kas</i> or ghosts of Na-nefer-ka-ptah, his wife (and sister)
Ahura, and their little boy Merab; and with them was the book. To
dissuade Setna from abstracting the book, Ahura tells him how they had
become possessed of it, and had paid for it with their earthly lives;
and <i>it is with her tale that the papyrus begins</i>. Setna, however,
insists upon taking the book; but Na-nefer-ka-ptah challenges him, as
a good scribe and a learned man, to a trial of skill in a game, and in
the imposition of magical penalties on the loser. Setna agrees; but
being worsted, he calls in outside help and succeeds in carrying off
the book. Na-nefer-ka-ptah comforts Ahura for its loss by assuring her
that Setna shall ignominiously restore it. Setna studies the book with
delight; but presently, by the magic power of Na-nefer-ka-ptah, he
becomes the victim of an extraordinary hallucination, and the strength
of his spirit is broken because (in imagination at least) he is
steeped in impurity and crime. When he awakes from this trance,
Pharaoh persuades him to return the book to its dead owners. On his
return to the tomb, Na-nefer-ka-ptah exacts from him the promise to go
to the cemetery of Koptos and bring thence to Memphis the bodies of
Ahura and of Merab, which had been buried there, apart from him. Setna
duly performs his promise, and so the story ends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5263" id="Page_5263">[Pg 5263]</a></span></p>

<p>The only known copy of this tale appears to have been written in 251
B.C., the thirty-fifth year of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and it must have
been composed at least as late as the Sebennyte Dynasty, early in the
fourth century, although it refers to historical characters of a
thousand years before.</p>

<p>The story is more elaborate, and its plot is more coherent than is the
case with the earlier tales such as that of Anpu and Bata, in which
events succeed each other often without natural connection. The
language however is in simple narrative style, without any attempt at
fine writing.</p>

<p>At the point at which the mutilated papyrus begins, we find that Ahura
is telling Setna the story of her life. Apparently he has just been
told how she sent a messenger to the king, asking that she may be
married to her brother Na-nefer-ka-ptah. The king has refused her
request, and the messenger has reproached him for his unkindness; the
king replies:&mdash;]</p></div>

<p>"It is thou who art dealing wrongly towards me.  If it happen
that I have not a child after two children, is it the law
to marry the one with the other of them? I will marry
Naneferkaptah with the daughter of a commander of troops, and
I will marry Ahura with the son of another commander of troops:
it has so happened in our family much.'</p>

<p>"It came to pass that the amusement was set before Pharaoh,
and they came for me and took me to the amusement named,
and it happened that my soul was troubled exceedingly and I
behaved not in my manner of the previous day. Said Pharaoh to
me, 'Ahura, is it thou that didst cause them to come to me in
these anxieties, saying, "Let me marry with Naneferkaptah, my
elder brother"?'</p>

<p>"Said I to him, 'Let me marry with the son of a commander
of troops, and let him marry with the daughter of another commander
of troops: it has happened in our family much.'</p>

<p>"I laughed, Pharaoh laughed, and his soul was exceeding
gladdened. Said Pharaoh to the steward of the king's house,
'Let Ahura be taken to the house of Naneferkaptah to-night, and
let all things that are good be taken with her.'</p>

<p>"I was taken as a wife to the house of Naneferkaptah in the
night named, and a present of silver and gold was brought to
me; the household of Pharaoh caused them all to be brought to
me. And Naneferkaptah made a good day<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> with me; he received
all the heads of the household of Pharaoh. And he found me
pleasing, he quarreled not with me, ever, ever: each of us loved
his fellow. And when I was about to bear a child, report of it
was made before Pharaoh, and his soul was exceeding gladdened,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5264" id="Page_5264">[Pg 5264]</a></span>
and Pharaoh caused many things to be taken for me on the
instant; he caused to be brought to me a present of silver and
gold and royal linen, beautiful exceedingly. Then came my time
of bearing; I bore this boy that is before thee, whose name is
called Merab, and he was caused to write in the book of the
'House of Life.'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>"It came to pass that Naneferkaptah, my brother, had no
habit on the earth<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> but to walk in the cemetery of Memphis,
reading the writings that were in the catacombs of the Pharaohs,
with the tablets of the scribes of the 'House of Life,' and the
inscriptions that were on the monuments; and he was eager for
writing exceedingly.</p>

<p>"After these things it befell that there was a procession in
honor of Ptah; Naneferkaptah went into the temple to worship,
and he chanced to be walking behind the procession reading the
inscriptions that were in the shrines of the gods. An aged priest
saw him and laughed. Naneferkaptah said to him, 'For what art
thou laughing at me?'</p>

<p>"And he said:&mdash;'I am not laughing at thee; if I laughed, it
was that thou art reading writings that no one on earth has any
good of. If it be that thou seekest to read writings, come to me,
and I will bring thee to the place where that roll is which it was
Thoth that wrote with his own hand, and which goes down to
fetch the gods. There are two formulas of writing that are upon
it, and when thou readest the first formula thou will enchant
the heaven, the earth, the underworld, the mountains, and the
seas; thou shalt discover all that the birds of the heaven and the
creeping things shall say; thou shalt see the fishes of the deep,
for there is a power from God brings them into water above
them. And when thou readest the second formula, if it be that
thou art in Ament<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> thou takest thy form of earth again. Thou
wilt see the sun rising in the sky with his circle of gods, and
the moon in its form of shining.'</p>

<p>"And Naneferkaptah said, 'As the king liveth! Let a good
thing that thou dost desire be told me, and I will have it done
for thee, if thou wilt direct me to the place where this roll is.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5265" id="Page_5265">[Pg 5265]</a></span>"Said
the priest to Naneferkaptah: 'If it be that thou desirest
to be directed to the place where this roll is, thou shalt give me
three hundred ounces of silver for my funeral, and provide that
they shall make me two coffin cases as a great priest, rich in
silver.'</p>

<p>"Naneferkaptah called a lad, and caused to be given the three
hundred ounces of silver for the priest, and he caused to be done
what he desired for two coffin cases; he caused them to be made
as for a great and rich priest.</p>

<p>"Said the priest to Naneferkaptah:&mdash;'The roll named, it is in
the midst of the Sea of Koptos,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> in a box of iron. In the iron
box is a box of bronze, in the bronze box is a box of <i>Kedt</i> wood,
in the box of <i>Kedt</i> wood is a box of ivory and ebony, in the box
of ivory and ebony is a box of silver, in the box of silver is a
box of gold in which is the roll. There is a mile of snakes,
scorpions, and every kind of reptile surrounding the box in which
the roll is; there is a snake of eternity surrounding the box
named.'</p>

<p>"At the time of the relation that the priest made before Naneferkaptah,
Naneferkaptah knew not what place on earth he
was in.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> And he came out of the temple and related before me
all that the priest had said to him. He said to me, 'I shall go
to Koptos, I shall fetch this roll thence; I shall not be slow in
coming back to the north again.'</p>

<p>"It came to pass that I opposed the priest, saying: 'Beware of
this thing that thou hast spoken before him! Thou hast brought
to me the strife of the nome of Thebes;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> I have found it cruel.'
I caused my hand to stay<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> with Naneferkaptah, in order not to let
him go to Koptos. He did not hearken to me; he went before
Pharaoh and related before Pharaoh everything that the priest
had said to him&mdash;all. Pharaoh said to him, 'What is it that
thou desirest?'</p>

<p>"He said to him, 'Cause to be given to me the royal pleasure
boat with its equipment: I will take Ahura and Merab her boy
to the south with me; I will fetch this roll without delaying.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5266" id="Page_5266">[Pg 5266]</a></span>"They
gave him the royal pleasure-boat with its equipment,
and we went up on board it; we set sail and reached Koptos.
And they made report of it before the priests of Isis of Koptos
and the high priest of Isis; they came down to meet us, they
delayed not to meet Naneferkaptah; their women came down to
meet me also. We went up on shore; we went into the temple
of Isis and Harpokrates, and Naneferkaptah caused to be brought
ox, goose, and wine; he made a burnt-offering and a drink-offering
before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. We were taken
to a house exceeding beautiful, filled with all good things, and
Naneferkaptah spent four days making a good day with the priests
of Isis of Koptos, the women of the priests of Isis making a good
day with myself.</p>

<p>"Came the morning of our fifth day: Naneferkaptah caused to
be brought to him pure wax.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> He made a boat, furnished with
its crew and its tackle. He read a spell to them, he caused them
to live, he gave them breath, he cast them into the sea. He
loaded the royal pleasure-boat of Pharaoh with sand; he caused
the boat to be brought, he went on board. I sat by the sea
of Koptos, saying, 'I will discover what will become of him.'</p>

<p>"He said, 'Boatmen, row on with me as far as the place in
which this roll is.' And they rowed by night as by midday.</p>

<p>"And when he reached it, in three days, he threw sand before
him, then there became a space of dry land. And when he found
a mile of serpents and scorpions, and every kind of creeping thing
encompassing the box in which the roll was, and when he found
a snake of eternity encompassing the box, he read a spell to the
mile of serpents, scorpions, and every kind of creeping thing that
was around the box, and suffered them not to leap up. He went
to the place in which was the snake of eternity; he made battle
with it, he slew it. It lived; it made its form again. He made
battle with it again for a second time; he slew it: it lived. He
made battle with it again for a third time; he made it in two
pieces; he put sand between one piece and its fellow. It died;
it did not make its form ever again.</p>

<p>"Naneferkaptah went to the place where the box was. He
found that it was a box of iron; he opened it, he found a box of
bronze; he opened it, he found a box of <i>Kedt</i> wood; he opened
it, he found a box of ivory and ebony; he opened it, he found a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5267" id="Page_5267">[Pg 5267]</a></span>
box of silver; he opened it, he found a box of gold; he opened
it, he found the book in it. He took up the roll from in the box
of gold, he read a formula of writing from it. He enchanted
the heaven, the earth, the underworld, the mountains, and the
seas; he discovered all that the birds of the heaven with the fishes
of the deep, the beasts of the mountains said&mdash;all. He read
another formula of writing, he saw the Sun rising in the sky
with all his circle of gods, and the moon rising, and the stars in
their shapes; he saw the fishes of the deep, for there was a
power from God brought them into the water over them. He
read a spell to the sea, and restored it as it was. He embarked.
He said to the crew, 'Row on for me as far as the place to which
I go.' And they rowed at night like as at midday. When he
reached the place where I was, he found me sitting by the sea of
Koptos, without drinking or eating anything, without doing anything
on the earth, being in the likeness of one who has reached
the Good Houses.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>"I said to Naneferkaptah, 'O Naneferkaptah, let me see this
book, for which we have taken these pains!'</p>

<p>"He put the roll into my hand. I read a formula of writing
in it; I enchanted the heaven, the earth, the underworld, the
mountains, the seas; I discovered what the birds of the sky, the
fishes of the deep, and the beasts of the hills said&mdash;-all. I read
another formula of the writing, and I saw the sun rising in the
sky with his circle of gods; I saw the moon shining with all the
stars of the heaven in their nature; I saw the fishes of the deep,
for it was that a power from God brought them into the water
above where they were. As I could not write, it was that I
spoke to Naneferkaptah my elder brother, who was a good scribe
and a learned man exceedingly; and he caused to be brought
before him a piece of new papyrus; he wrote every word that
was on the roll before him&mdash;all. He dipped it in beer, he melted
it in water, he saw that it had been melted, he drank it, he
knew that which was in it.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>"We returned to Koptos on the day named: we made a good
day before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. We embarked, we
went down to the river, we reached north of Koptos by one mile.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5268" id="Page_5268">[Pg 5268]</a></span>
Behold, Thoth had discovered everything that happened to Naneferkaptah
on account of the roll; Thoth delayed not, he complained
before the Sun, saying, 'Know my right, my judgment
with Naneferkaptah the son of Pharaoh Mernebptah! He went
to my place, he robbed it, he took my box containing my book,
he killed my guard who was watching it.'</p>

<p>"It was said to him, 'He is before thee, with every man that
belongeth to him&mdash;all.'<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>"There was sent a power from God down from heaven, saying,
'Let not Naneferkaptah go to Memphis safe, with every man that
belongeth to him&mdash;all.'</p>

<p>"An hour passed: Merab, the boy, came out from under the
awning of the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh, he fell into the river, he
did the will of Ra. Everybody that was on board uttered a cry&mdash;all.
Naneferkaptah came out from under his cabin, he read a
writing over him, he caused him to come up, for it was that a
power from God in the water was laid on his upper side.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> He
read a writing over him, he made him relate before him of everything
that had happened to him&mdash;all, and the accusation that
Thoth made before Ra.</p>

<p>"We returned to Koptos with him. We caused him to be
taken to the Good House and laid in state; we caused him to be
embalmed like a prince and great man; we caused him to rest in
his coffin in the cemetery of Koptos.</p>

<p>"Said Naneferkaptah my brother, 'Let us go down the river,
let us not delay before Pharaoh hear the things that have happened
to us, and his soul be sad therefore.'</p>

<p>"We embarked, we went down-stream, we delayed not; and
traveled to the north of Koptos by one mile. At the place of
the falling of Merab the boy into the river, I came out from
under the awning of the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh, I fell into the
river, I did the will of Ra. Everybody that was on board uttered
a cry&mdash;all. They told it to Naneferkaptah, he came out from
under the awning of the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh, he read a
writing over me, he caused me to leap up, for it was that a
power from God in the water rested on my upper side. He
caused me to be taken up, he read a writing over me, he caused
me to relate before him everything that had happened unto me&mdash;all;
and the accusation that Thoth had made before Ra. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5269" id="Page_5269">[Pg 5269]</a></span>
returned to Koptos with me, he caused me to be brought to the
Good House, he caused me to be laid in state, he caused me to
be embalmed with the embalmment of a prince and very great
person, he caused me to rest in the tomb where Merab the boy
lay.</p>

<p>"He embarked, he went down-stream, he hastened north of
Koptos by one mile to the place of our falling into the river.
He spake with his soul, saying:&mdash;'Can I go to Koptos and dwell
there? Otherwise, if it be that I go to Memphis, the moment
that Pharaoh asks me after his children, what shall I say to him?
Can I tell it to him, saying, I took thy children to the nome of
Thebes, I killed them, I being alive; I came to Memphis, I being
alive still?'</p>

<p>"He caused them to bring a strip of royal linen before him;
he made it into a girdle. He bound the roll, he put it upon his
stomach, he made it firm. Naneferkaptah came out from under
the awning of the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh, he fell into the river,
he did the will of Ra. Everybody that was on board uttered a
cry&mdash;all, saying: 'Great woe! Oppressive woe! Has he gone
back,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> the good scribe, the learned man, to whom there is no
equal?'</p>

<p>"The pleasure-boat of Pharaoh went down-stream, without any
one on earth knowing where Naneferkaptah was. They reached
Memphis, they made report of it before Pharaoh. Pharaoh came
down to meet the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh in mourning, the army
of Memphis took mourning&mdash;all, together with the priests of Ptah,
the chief prophet of Ptah, with the officials and household of
Pharaoh&mdash;all. They saw Naneferkaptah clinging to the rudders
of the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh, by virtue of his art of a good
scribe. They drew him up, they saw the roll on his stomach.
Said Pharaoh, 'Let this roll that is on his stomach be hidden
away.'</p>

<p>"Said the officers of Pharaoh, with the priests of Ptah, and
the chief prophet of Ptah, before Pharaoh: 'O our great lord the
King, may he accomplish the duration of Ra!<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Naneferkaptah
was a good scribe, a learned man exceedingly.'</p>

<p>"Pharaoh caused to be given to him entrance to the Good
House for sixteen days, wrapping for thirty-five and coffining for
seventy; he was caused to rest in his tomb, in his places of
rest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5270" id="Page_5270">[Pg 5270]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Having finished her story, Ahura proceeds to point out the moral to
Setna.]</p></div>

<p>"I am suffering the ills which have come upon us because of
this roll of which thou sayest, 'Let it be given to me!' Thou
hast no claim to it: our life on earth has been taken for it."</p>

<p>Said Setna, "Ahura, let this roll be given me which I see
between thee and Naneferkaptah, else will I take it by force."</p>

<p>Rose Naneferkaptah on the couch; he said: "Art thou Setna,
before whom this woman has told these misfortunes which thou
hast not suffered&mdash;all? The book named, canst thou take it only
by strength of a good scribe? It were sufficient to play draughts
with me. Let us play for it at the game of fifty-two points."</p>

<p>And Setna said, "I am ready."</p>

<p>The board and its pieces were put before them. They played
at the fifty-two, and Naneferkaptah won a game from Setna. He
[Naneferkaptah] read a spell over him; he [Setna] defended himself
with the game-board that was before him. He [Naneferkaptah]
made him [Setna] go into the ground as far as his feet.
He did its like in the second game; he won it from Setna, he
made him go into the ground as far as his middle. He did its
like in the third game; he made him go into the ground as far
as his ears. After these things Setna made a great blow on the
hand of Naneferkaptah. Setna called to Anheru, his brother by
Anherart,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> saying: "Make haste and go up upon the earth, do
thou relate of everything that has happened to me before Pharaoh,
and do thou bring the amulets of Ptah my father,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and
my rolls of magic."</p>

<p>He hastened up upon earth, he related before Pharaoh of
everything that had happened to Setna. Said Pharaoh, "Take to
him the amulets of Ptah his father, and his rolls of magic."</p>

<p>Anheru hastened down into the tomb; he laid the talismans on
the body of Setna, he [Setna] sprang to heaven at the moment
named.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Setna caused his hand to go after the roll, he took it.
It came to pass that Setna went up from the tomb, Light walking
before him and Darkness walking behind him, and Ahura
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5271" id="Page_5271">[Pg 5271]</a></span>
weeping after him, saying, "Hail to thee, King Darkness! Farewell
to thee, King Light! All consolation is gone that was in the
tomb."</p>

<p>Said Naneferkaptah to Ahura, "Be not troubled of soul; I
will make him bring this book hither, there being a fork for a
staff in his hand, there being a pan of fire on his head."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>And Setna came up from the tomb, he made it fast behind
him in its manner.</p>

<p>Setna went before Pharaoh, he related before him of the
thing that had happened to him with the roll. Said Pharaoh to
Setna, "Take this roll to the tomb of Naneferkaptah in the manner
of a prudent man, else he will make thee bring it, there
being a fork for a staff in thine hand, there being a pan of fire
on thine head."</p>

<p>Not did Setna hearken to him. It came to pass that Setna
had no habit on earth but unrolling the roll and reading it
before everybody.</p>

<p>After these things there was a day when Setna passed time
in the court of Ptah, and saw a woman beautiful exceedingly,
there being no woman of her beauty. There were ornaments of
much gold upon her, there were children and women walking
behind her, there were fifty-two persons of chiefs of households
assigned to her. The hour that Setna saw her he knew not the
place on earth where he was. Setna called to his attendant
youth, saying, "Go quickly to the place where this woman is;
learn what comes under her command."</p>

<p>The attendant youth went quickly to the place where the
woman was, he addressed the handmaid who walked behind her,
he asked her, saying, "What person is this woman?" She said
to him, "She is Tabubua, the daughter of the prophet of Bast,
lady of Ankhtaui, she having come hither to pray before Ptah
the great god."</p>

<p>The youth went back to Setna, he related before him of
everything that she had told him&mdash;all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[In his infatuation for this woman, Setna forgets all decorum and all duty,
and follows her home to Bubastis, and "ashamed was every one that was
about Setna." To win the favor of Tabubua, he hands over to her all his
possessions and the inheritance of his children; and at length she demands
that his children should be put to death to prevent disputes.]</p></div>

<p>Setna said, "Let there be done unto them the abomination
that has entered thy heart."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5272" id="Page_5272">[Pg 5272]</a></span></p>

<p>She caused his children to be slain before his face; she caused
them to be cast down from the window before the dogs and the
cats. They devoured their flesh, he hearing them, he drinking
with Tabubua.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Setna awakens from the trance in which he has in imagination sunk to
such depths of wickedness, to find himself lying naked in a strange place.]</p></div>

<p>An hour it was that passed when Setna saw a great man
riding on a chariot, there being many men running at his feet,
he being like Pharaoh. Setna came to rise; he could not rise for
shame, for there was no clothing upon him. Pharaoh said,
"Setna, what has befallen thee in this state in which thou art?"</p>

<p>Said he, "Naneferkaptah is he who hath done this to me&mdash;all."</p>

<p>Pharaoh said, "Go to Memphis: thy children they are seeking
for thee; they are standing on their feet before Pharaoh."</p>

<p>Setna said before Pharaoh, "My great lord the King, may he
accomplish the duration of Ra! What is the manner of going to
Memphis that I can do, there being no clothes on earth upon
me?"</p>

<p>Pharaoh called to a youth standing by, he made him give
clothing to Setna. Said Pharaoh to Setna, "Go to Memphis:
thy children, they are alive, they are standing on their feet
before Pharaoh."</p>

<p>Setna came to Memphis, he embraced his children with hand,
he found them alive. Pharaoh said, "Is it drinking that hath
brought thee thus?"</p>

<p>Setna related everything that had happened to him with Tabubua,
with Naneferkaptah&mdash;all. Pharaoh said: "Setna, I put my
hand upon thee before,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> saying, 'Thou wilt be slain if thou dost
not take this roll to the place from which it was brought.' Thou
didst not listen to me till this hour. Give this roll to Naneferkaptah,
there being a forked stick for a staff in thine hand, there
being a pan of fire on thine head."</p>

<p>Setna came out from before Pharaoh, there being a forked
stick for a staff in his hand, there being a pan of fire on his
head. He went down to the tomb in which was Naneferkaptah.
Ahura said to him, "Setna, it is Ptah the great god who hath
brought thee back safe."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5273" id="Page_5273">[Pg 5273]</a></span></p>

<p>Naneferkaptah laughed, saying, "This is a thing that I told
thee before."</p>

<p>Setna saluted Naneferkaptah; he found him as it is said,
"He is the sun that is in the whole tomb." Ahura and Naneferkaptah
saluted Setna greatly. Setna said, "Naneferkaptah,
is there aught that is disgraceful?"</p>

<p>Naneferkaptah said, "Setna, thou knowest this, that Ahura
and Merab her child, they are in Koptos: bring them here into
this tomb by the skill of a good scribe. Let it be commanded
before thee, and do thou take pains, and do thou go to Koptos,
and do thou bring them hither."</p>

<p>Setna came up from the tomb and went before Pharaoh; he
related before Pharaoh of everything that Naneferkaptah had
said to him&mdash;all.</p>

<p>Pharaoh said, "Setna, go to Koptos, bring Ahura and Merab
her child."</p>

<p>He said before Pharaoh, "Let the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh be
given to me with its equipment."</p>

<p>The pleasure-boat of Pharaoh was given to him with its equipment;
he embarked, he sailed up, he did not delay, he arrived
at Koptos.</p>

<p>Information of it was given before the priests of Isis of Koptos,
and the chief prophet of Isis. They came down to meet
him, they took his hand to the shore. He went up, he went
into the temple of Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. He caused
ox, goose, wine to be brought; he made a burnt-offering, a
drink-offering, before Isis of Koptos and Harpokrates. He went
to the cemetery of Koptos, with the priests of Isis and the chief
prophet of Isis; they spent three days and three nights searching
in the tombs which were in the cemetery of Koptos&mdash;all, turning
over the stel&aelig; of the scribes of the House of Life, reading the
inscriptions that were on them. They found not the places of
rest in which were Ahura and Merab her son.</p>

<p>Naneferkaptah perceived that they found not the places of
rest of Ahura and Merab her son. He rose from the dead as
an old man, great of age exceedingly. He came to meet Setna,
and Setna saw him. Setna said to the old man, "Thou art of
the appearance of a man great of age: knowest thou the places
of rest in which are Ahura and Merab her child?"</p>

<p>The old man said to Setna, "The father of the father of my
father told to the father of my father, and the father of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5274" id="Page_5274">[Pg 5274]</a></span>
father told to my father, that the resting-places of Ahura and
Merab her child are by the south corner of the house of Pehemato,
as his name is."</p>

<p>Said Setna to the old man, "Is it not an injury that Pehemato
hath done thee, by reason of which thou comest to cause his
house to be brought down to the ground?"</p>

<p>The old man said to Setna, "Let watch be set over me and
let the house of Pehemato be taken down. If it be that they
find not Ahura and Merab her child under the south corner of
his house, may abomination be done to me."</p>

<p>A watch was set over the old man; the resting-place of Ahura
and Merab her child was found under the south corner of the
house of Pehemato. Setna caused them to enter as great people
on the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh; he caused the house of Pehemato
to be built in its former manner. Naneferkaptah made
Setna to discover what had happened: that it was he who had
come to Koptos to let them find the resting-place in which Ahura
and Merab her child were.</p>

<p>Setna embarked on the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh, he went
down the river, he did not delay, he reached Memphis with all
the army that was with him&mdash;all. Report was made of it before
Pharaoh, he came down to meet the pleasure-boat of Pharaoh.
He caused them to be introduced as great persons to the tomb
where Naneferkaptah was, he caused dirges to be made above
them.</p>

<h3>THE STELA OF PIANKHY</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The following inscription, one of the longest in existence, covers
both faces and the sides of a large stela of black basalt in the
Museum at G&icirc;zeh. It was found in the temple of Gebel Barkal, beyond
Dongola in Nubia. Here was one of the capitals of a native Ethiopian
dynasty, and in the temple dedicated to Amen a number of historical
stel&aelig; were set up by different kings, of whom Piankhy (about 800 B.C.)
was the earliest. Not improbably he was descended from the priest
kings of the XXIst Egyptian dynasty (at Thebes, about 1000 B.C.); at
any rate, the name which he bore occurs in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5275" id="Page_5275">[Pg 5275]</a></span>that dynasty, and his
devotion to Amen agrees with the theory. We learn from the stela that
by some means he had obtained the suzerainty over Upper Egypt, which
was governed by local kings and nomarchs; while Lower Egypt was
similarly divided but independent. Among the princes of the North land
the most powerful was Tafnekht, probably a Libyan nomarch of Sais who
had absorbed the whole of the western side of Lower Egypt. The stela
relates the conflict that ensued when Tafnekht endeavored to unite
Lower Egypt in a confederacy and invade the Upper Country. This gave
Piankhy, who knew his own strength, an opportunity of which he was not
slow to avail himself. The Delta was protected from invasion by its
network of canals, and by its extensive marshes. But when the armies
and navies of the local kings had been drawn into Upper Egypt and
there repeatedly defeated, weakened and cowed, the princes of the
North Land were at the mercy of the victorious Ethiopian, who was
rewarded for his activity and skill in strategy with an abundance of
spoil and tribute, probably also with the permanent subjection of the
country.</p>

<p>The inscription is in a very perfect state; with the exception of one
lacuna of sixteen short lines the losses are very small. The narrative
is far more artistic and sustained than was usual in records of any
considerable length. The piety of the Ethiopian and his trust in his
god Amen are remarkably indicated; and some passages cannot fail to
remind us of the Biblical records of certain Jewish kings and of the
prophecies concerning Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus. There is nothing that
suggests the bloodthirstiness and wanton cruelty of the contemporary
kings of Assyria. Altogether, when the time and circumstances are
taken into account, the impression left is one very favorable to
Piankhy. If he seems to insist overmuch on his Divine mission, this
exaggeration is perhaps due to the priests of Amen who drafted the
document, desirous of thereby promoting the honor both of their god
and of their king.</p>

<p>There are numerous indications in the signs composing the inscription
that the text was written originally in a cursive character, and
afterwards transcribed into hieroglyphics for record on stone.]</p></div>

<p class="center">[Anxiety of the King's governors in Upper Egypt at Tafnekht's progress.

<p>Behold these chiefs, nomarchs, and captains of the host who
were in their various cities sent to his Majesty daily, saying:

gifts, as his heart inclineth, of all things that he findeth [therein]."</p>

<p class="center">[Piankhy orders the governors to besiege Hermopolis.]</p>

<p>Then his Majesty sent a message to the nomarchs and the
captains of the host who were in Egypt, the captain Puarma,
with the captain Armersekny, with every captain of his Majesty
who was in Egypt, saying: "Make haste in striking, join battle,
encircle [Hermopolis], capture its people, its cattle, its ships
upon the river. Let not the fell&acirc;h&icirc;n come out to the field; let
not the plowman plow; lay siege to the Hare-city,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> fight against

<p class="center">[Piankhy dispatches an army from Ethiopia, bidding them fear not to fight,
for Amen is their strength; and to do homage unto the god at Thebes.]</p>

<p>Then his Majesty sent an army to Egypt, urging them very

drafts, so that ye fight according as ye see that he hath arrayed
battle at a distance. If he say the infantry and cavalry have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5278" id="Page_5278">[Pg 5278]</a></span>
hastened to another city, why then remain ye until his army
come, and fight even as he shall say. And if his allies are in
another city, hasten ye to them; and the nomarchs, and those
whom he bringeth to strengthen him, the Tehenu<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and his
chosen troops, let battle be arrayed against them. One of old
saith:&mdash;'We know not how to cry unto him. It is the enlistment
of troops and the yoking of war-horses, the pick of thy stables,
that giveth victory in battle. Thou knowest that Amen is the
god that leadeth us.'<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

ye into the water, wash ye in the river, dress on the bank of
the stream, unstring the bow, loosen the arrow. Let no chief
boast as possessing might, there being no strength to the mighty
if he regard him [Amen] not. He maketh the feeble-handed
into strong-handed; a multitude may turn their backs before
the few; one man may conquer a thousand. Sprinkle yourselves
with the water of his altars; kiss ye the ground before his
face; say ye to him, 'Give unto us a way that we may fight
in the shadow of thy strong arm. The band that thou leadest, it
cometh to pass that it overthroweth that which hath overthrown
many.'"</p>

<p>Then they cast themselves on their bellies before his Majesty
[saying], "It is thy name that giveth us strength of arm, thy
wisdom is the mooring-post<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> of thy soldiers; thy bread is in our

myself to ruin that which [Nemart] hath done; I will cause him
to withdraw from battle forever. Verily, after performing the

in his beautiful festival, when he maketh his fair manifestation of

and in the East, and in the islands in the midst, came to see the
beauties of his Majesty. The <i>erpa</i> Pediast threw himself on his
belly before his Majesty, and said: "Come to Kakem, that thou
mayest see the god Khentkhety; that thou mayest <i>khu</i> [?] the
goddess Khuyt; that thou mayest offer sacrifices to Horus in his
house, consisting of fat bulls, oxen, fowls; that thou mayest
enter my house, open my treasury, and load thyself with the
things of my father. I will give thee gold unto the limits of thy
desire, malachite heaped before thy face, horses many of the best
of the stable, the leaders of the stall."</p>

<p class="center">[Piankhy goes to Athribis and worships the local god. Pediast sets the example

<p>Proceeded his Majesty to the house of Horus Khentkhety,
and caused to be offered fat bulls, oxen, ducks, fowl to his father
Horus Khentkhety, lord of Kemur. Proceeded his Majesty to
the house of the <i>erpa</i> Pediast; he presented him with silver,
gold, lapis lazuli, malachite, a great collection of every kind of
thing, and stuffs, and royal linen in every count,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> couches covered
with fine linen, frankincense, and unguents in jars, stallions and

of the North land:&mdash;"Each one of them that hides his horses,
that conceals his goods, let him die the death of his father.
Thus may it be done to me, whether ye acquit thy humble servant
in all things that ye knew of concerning me, or whether ye
say I have hidden from his Majesty anything of my father, gold,
jewelry, with minerals and ornaments of all kinds, bracelets for
the arms, collars for the neck, pendants [?] inlaid with minerals,
amulets for every limb, chaplets for the head, rings for the ears,
all the apparel of a king, every vessel of royal purification in
gold, and every sort of mineral; all these things I have offered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5292" id="Page_5292">[Pg 5292]</a></span>

<p>Then his Majesty caused his warriors to go to see what took

Let me go out to the temple in his sight, let me clear myself

<p>His Majesty caused to go the Chief Lector Pediamennestaui,
and the captain of the host Puarma. He [Tafnekht] presented
him [Piankhy] with silver, gold, stuffs, every valuable mineral.
He went out to the temple, he praised God, he cleared himself
with an oath by God, saying: "I will not transgress the
command of the King. I will not reject the words of his
Majesty; I will not sin against a nomarch without thy knowledge;
I will act according to the words of the King; I will not transgress
what he hath commanded." Then his Majesty was satisfied

is not a nome that is shut against his Majesty in the nomes

<p>Then the ships were loaded with silver, gold, bronze, stuffs,

the Divine Land.</p>

<p>His Majesty went up-stream, his heart enlarged, all about him
were rejoicing; West and East, they rose high, rejoicing around
his Majesty, singing and rejoicing; they said:&mdash;"O mighty King!
O mighty King! Piankhy! O mighty King! Thou hast come,
thou hast ruled the North land. Thou makest bulls into women.
Happy is the heart of the mother that bore a male child, that
was impregnated with thee amongst the mountains. Praises be
given unto her! the cow that hath borne a bull! Thou shalt be

and the heart of his Majesty was satisfied with me.</p>

<p class="center">[Appointment as principal judge in the trial of the queen.]</p>

<p>Now when I was judge, his Majesty made me a sole friend

the chief royal wife Aamtesi as a secret affair, his Majesty
caused me to enter to it and hear the case alone, without there
being any chief justice and vizier, or any officer there but me
only, on account of my success and rooting in the heart of his

<p>The reapers, represented cutting corn in the tomb of Paheri (XVIIIth
Dynasty), are supposed to be chanting a little song, the words of
which are engraved above their figures. Such songs are very
common among the fell&acirc;h&icirc;n of the present day, who thus mark time
for their work in the fields or on the river. This song is introduced
by a phrase which seems to speak of it as being "in answering
chant"; and this perhaps gives us the technical Egyptian term for
antiphonal singing.</p>

<p><i>In answering chant they say</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is a good day! to the land come out | The north wind is out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sky works according to our heart | Let us work, binding firm our heart.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The following transcription of the original Egyptian may give
some idea of the assonances of words and ordered repetitions which
marked the poetical style; the main repetitions are here italicized.</p>

<p><i>Khen en usheb, zet-sen:</i>&mdash;</p>

the same tomb there is another song, already well known but
less noticeable in form than the above. It is sung to the oxen on

<h3><a name="LOVE_SONGS" id="LOVE_SONGS"></a>LOVE SONGS</h3>

<p>Some of the prettiest Egyptian poetry is contained in a papyrus of
the XVIIIth Dynasty at the British Museum. The verses are
written in hieratic, and are extremely difficult to translate, but
their beauty is apparent to the translator even when he cannot fix
the sense. A new edition of these and other poems of a kindred
nature is being prepared by Professor W. Max M&uuml;ller of Philadelphia,
who kindly permits us to make some extracts from the advance
sheets of his publication.</p>

<p>The songs are collected in small groups, generally entitled 'Songs
of Entertainment.' The lover and his mistress call each other
"brother" and "sister." In one song the girl addresses her lover in
successive stanzas under the names of different plants in a garden,
and plays on these names. Others are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="HYMN_TO_USERTESEN_III" id="HYMN_TO_USERTESEN_III"></a>HYMN TO USERTESEN III.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[This hymn is the most remarkable example of Egyptian poetry known to
us. It was found by Mr. Petrie near the pyramid and temple of Usertesen II.,
in the town which was founded there for the accommodation of the workmen
employed upon these buildings, and for the priestly staff who performed the
services for the dead Pharaoh in his chapel. The hymn is addressed to the
son and successor of that king,&mdash;to Usertesen III.,&mdash;an active and warlike
prince, who, as the poet also testifies, used his power for the benefit of his
country and the pious support of its institutions. It is a marvel that the
delicate papyrus on which the hymn is written should have been preserved for
nearly 5,000 years. It has not, however, resisted the attacks of time without
suffering injury; and the lacun&aelig;, together with the peculiar language employed
by the scribe, are baffling to the decipherer. Four stanzas only can be
read with comparative completeness and certainty.</p>

<p>The parallelism of the sentences, the rhythm, the balancing of the lines of
verse, and the pause in each, recall the style of the Hebrew Psalms. The
choice of metaphors, too, is in a similar direction. Unfortunately our limited
knowledge of the ancient language does not permit us to analyze closely the
structure of the verses, nor to attempt any scansion of them. The radicals
only of Egyptian words are known to us; of the pronunciation of the language
at the time of the XIIth Dynasty we are entirely ignorant.]</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following hymn addressed by King Akhenaten (B.C. 1450) to
his one god, the visible Sun itself, was perhaps originally written
in ten-line stanzas like the 'Hymn to Usertesen III.,' but
the known texts of it are all too mutilated and uncertain for us to
attempt any thorough restoration of the composition at present. A
good edition of the hymn has been published by Professor Breasted
of Chicago, and his text is here followed.</p>

<p>King Akhenaten was one of the most original minds known to us
in Egyptian history. His bringing up was probably far more favorable
to awakening powers of thought than was usually the case with
the Pharaohs. Through his mother, Queen Tiy, he had been in
close contact with the religions of Mesopotamia, perhaps even with
Israelite monotheism; suddenly he cast off the traditions of his own
country and all its multitudinous deities of heaven, earth, and the
underworld, and devoted himself to the worship of one god, visible
and exalted, before whom all else seemed either petty, gross, or
unreal. His motto, as Professor Petrie has remarked, was "living in
truth"; and according to his lights he lived up to it. Fervently he
adored his god; and we may well believe that the words of this
hymn are those which flowed from his own heart as he contemplated
the mighty and beneficent power of the Sun.</p>

<p>This heretical doctrine roused the passions of the orthodox, who,
triumphing over Akhenaten's reform, condemned his monuments to
systematic destruction.</p></div>

<h3><a name="HYMNS_TO_AMEN_RA221" id="HYMNS_TO_AMEN_RA221"></a>HYMNS TO AMEN RA<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></h3>

<p>The following collection of hymns to Amen Ra is from the orthodox
worship of the New Kingdom; that is to say, it dates
from the period beginning in the XVIIth Dynasty, about 1700
B.C. The series is contained in a papyrus now preserved in the
museum at G&icirc;zeh and in very perfect condition.</p>

<p>In the original, the lines are punctuated with red dots, and the
stanzas are marked by rubrics, a very valuable clue being thus provided
both as to meanings and form.</p>

<p>The first hymn is divided into five stanzas of seven lines each,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
but the fourth stanza contains an error of punctuation which has
perhaps prevented this arrangement from being noticed hitherto.
The other hymns do not appear to be so divisible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5310" id="Page_5310">[Pg 5310]</a></span>The
text presents several instances of embellishment by far-fetched,
and to our minds very feeble, puns and punning assonances.
It is impossible to reproduce these to the English reader, but some
lines in which they occur are here marked with asterisks indicating
the words in question.</p>

<p>Although these hymns have been much admired, it must be confessed
that they are somewhat arid in comparison with the simple
expression of Akhenaten's devotion in the 'Hymn to the Aten.' To
the Egyptians, however, the mythological references were full of
meaning, while to us they are never fully intelligible. Such an enumeration
as that of the symbols and insignia of divine royalty which
we find in the second hymn, is as empty to us as references to the
Stars and Stripes, the White House, the Spread Eagle, the Union Jack,
the Rose, the Shamrock, and the Thistle may be to the lords of the
world in 5000 to 6000 A.D.</p>

<h3><a name="SONGS_TO_THE_HARP" id="SONGS_TO_THE_HARP"></a>SONGS TO THE HARP</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Frequently in the tombs is figured a scene in which a harper plays before
the deceased. His song is ever on the same theme: Enjoy life while it lasts,
for all things pass away, and are succeeded by others which also perish in
their turn. Such were the encouragements to conviviality which the Egyptians
put into the mouths of their minstrels.</p>

<p>One of these songs was apparently engraved in front of the figure of a
harper in the tomb or pyramid of King Antef (of the XIth or perhaps XIIIth
Dynasty, not less than 2000 B.C.), and a copy of it has been handed down
to us on a papyrus of the XVIIIth Dynasty: fragments of the same song
are moreover preserved at Leyden on slabs from a tomb of the same period.</p>

<p>Part of another song of the same kind may be read on the walls of the
fine tomb of Neferhetep at Thebes (<i>temp.</i> XVIIIth Dynasty). This song
was a long one, but the latter part of it is now mutilated and hopelessly destroyed;
yet enough of the sequel remains to show that it rose to a somewhat
higher level of teaching than the first song, and counseled men to feed the
poor and to win a good name to leave behind them after death.</p>

<p>The songs seem to fall naturally into stanzas of ten lines each, though
the inscriptions and papyri on which they are preserved to us are not punctuated
to indicate these divisions. In the first song the ten lines fall readily
into pairs, thus producing five-line stanzas.]</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[In the British Museum there is a memorial tablet of Ptolemaic date for a
lady of highest sacerdotal descent, on her mother's side as well as on her
father's. She was married to the chief priest of Ptah, and on her death she
addresses her male relations and friends among the priests of chief rank with
words and sentiments very different from the orthodox prayers and formul&aelig;
which cover the funerary stel&aelig; of Pharaonic times; though much the same
line of thought found utterance in the songs of the harpers.]</p></div>


<p>O brother, husband, friend, thy desire to drink and to eat
hath not ceased, [therefore] be drunken, enjoy the love of
women, make holiday. Follow thy desire by night and by
day. Put not care within thine heart. Lo! are not these the
years of thy life upon earth? For as for Amenti, it is a land of
slumber and of heavy darkness, a resting-place for those who
have passed within it. Each sleepeth [there] in his own form;
they never more awake to see their fellows, they behold not
their fathers nor their mothers, their heart is careless of their
wives and children.</p>

called of him come to him instantly, their hearts terrified with
fear of him. There is none whom he regardeth among gods or
men; with him the great are as the small. His hand cannot
be held back from aught that he desireth; he snatcheth the child
from its mother, as well as the aged who are continually meeting
him on his way. All men fear and pray before him, but he
heedeth them not. None cometh to gaze on him in wonder; he
hearkeneth not unto them who adore him. He is not seen<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> that

<h3><a name="THE_NEGATIVE_CONFESSION" id="THE_NEGATIVE_CONFESSION"></a>'THE NEGATIVE CONFESSION'</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[It may be thought that the fundamental ideas of Egyptian morality
would be most succinctly expressed in the so-called 'Negative Confession'
contained in the 'Book of the Dead.' When the deceased appeared before
Osiris he was supposed to recite this confession, in which he alleged his freedom
from a long catalogue of sins: he repeated it in two forms. After the
XVIIIth Dynasty, B.C. 1500, it was considered as perhaps the most essential
of all the texts deposited in the tomb with the mummy, for the guidance of
the deceased person before his fate was finally settled. It is therefore to be
found in thousands of copies, but unfortunately this much-worn text is as
corrupt as most of the other sections of the Book of the Dead. The hack
scribes and calligraphists were content to copy without understanding it, often
bungling or wresting the sense according to their very imperfect lights. It is
seldom that different copies agree precisely in their readings: often the differences
are very material and leave the true sense altogether uncertain. Again,
even where the reading seems comparatively sure, the meaning remains
obscure, owing to the occurrence of rare words or expressions. All the
phrases begin with the negative "not."]</p></div>

<h3><a name="THE_TEACHING_OF_AMENEMHAT" id="THE_TEACHING_OF_AMENEMHAT"></a>THE TEACHING OF AMENEMHAT</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The advice given by Amenemhat I., the founder of the XIIth Dynasty,
to his son and successor Usertesen I. (about B.C. 2500), is a short composition
that was much in vogue during the New Kingdom as an exercise for
schoolboys. Six copies of portions or of the whole have survived to our
day; but with one exception all are very corrupt, and the text is extremely
difficult to translate. Our oldest copies appear to date from the middle of
the XIXth Dynasty (about B.C. 1300). But the composition itself must be
older than this; indeed, it may be a true record of the great King's charge
to his son.</p>

<p>The following seems to be the purpose and argument of the work. Amenemhat,
who has already virtually associated Usertesen with himself in the
kingdom, determines in consequence of a plot against his life to insure his
son's succession by announcing it in a formal manner. He has labored strenuously
and successfully for his own glory and for the good of his people, but
in return he is scarcely saved from ignominious dethronement or assassination
through a conspiracy formed in his own household. The moral to
be drawn from this is pointed out to his son with considerable bitterness and
scorn in the 'Teaching,' in which, however, Usertesen is promised a brilliant
reign if he will attend to his father's instructions.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth while noticing that there is no expression of piety or
reference to the worship of divinities either in the precepts themselves or in
the narrative. The personified Nile is spoken of in a manner that would be
likely to offend its worshipers; but in the last section, the interpretation of
which is extremely doubtful, Amenemhat seems to acquiesce in the orthodox
views concerning the god Ra.</p>

<p>Usertesen's reign dates from Amenemhat's XXth year, and that his association
was then no secret but already formally acknowledged, is amply
proved. The King seems to feel already the approach of old age and death,
and though he lived on to assist his son with his counsel for no less than
ten years, it was apparently in retirement from public life.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The work has
been considered as a posthumous charge to Usertesen, but although certain
expressions seem to support this view, on the whole I think its correctness
improbable.</p>

<p>In several copies the text is divided by rubrics into fifteen paragraphs, and
the phrases are punctuated by dots placed above the lines. In the following
rendering the paragraphs are preserved, and summarized where they are too
difficult to translate. The incompleteness of the best text leaves the last two
paragraphs in almost hopeless confusion.]</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5324" id="Page_5324">[Pg 5324]</a></span></p>

<p><br />1. [Title and introduction.]</p>

<p>Commencement in the teaching made by the majesty of the
King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Sehetepabra, Son of the
Sun, Amenemhat, justified, which he spake as a dividing
of truth<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> to his Son, the Universal Lord. Said he:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Shine forth as a God! Hearken to that I say to thee, that
thou mayest be king of the land and rule the territories, that
thou mayest excel in all wealth.</p>

<p><br />2. [Exhortation to caution in associating with subjects.]</p>

<p>"Let one be armored against his associates as a whole; it
befalleth that mankind turn their heart to him who inspireth
them with fear. Enter not to them singly; fill not thy heart
with a brother; know not an honored friend; make not to thyself
free-and-easy visitors, by which nothing is accomplished.</p>

<p><br />3. [Trust not to the aid of friends.]</p>

<p>"When thou liest down, keep to thyself thine own heart; for
friends exist not for a man on the day of troubles. I gave to
the beggar, and I made the orphan to exist<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>; I caused the man
of no position to obtain his purpose even as the man of position.</p>

<p><br />4. [Continuation of 3: Reward of his beneficence.]</p>

<p>"It was the eater of my food that made insurrection; he
to whom I gave a helping hand produced terror therewith; they
who put on my fine linen looked on me as shadows<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>; they who
were anointed with my frankincense defiled me while using it.</p>

<p><br />5. [Men forget the heroism of his achievements on their behalf,
though their happy condition speaks loudly of it; by forgetting
they lose much of the advantages he has procured them.]</p>

<p>"My portraits are among the living, my achievements among
men, making for me dirges that none heed, a great feat of
combat that none see. Behold, one fighteth for a lassoed ox,
that forgetteth yesterday. Good fortune is not complete for one
who cannot know it.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5325" id="Page_5325">[Pg 5325]</a></span></p>

<p><br />6. [An attempt upon his life: circumstances of the attack.]</p>

<p>"It was after supper, and night was come on. I took an
hour of heart pleasure; I lay down upon my <i>diw&acirc;n</i>; I sank-in-rest,
my heart began to follow slumber. Behold! weapons were
brandished [?], and there was conversation concerning me; while
I acted like the serpent of the desert.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><br />7. [Taken by surprise, he could not defend himself.]</p>

<p>"I awoke to fight; I was alone. I found that it was the
stroke of an ally. If I had taken swiftly the arms from his
hand I should have caused the cowards to retreat, by dint of
smiting round. But there is not a man of valor at night; there
is no fighting single-handed; there happens not a successful bout
in ignorance. Behold thou me.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p><br />8. [Usertesen's association the only safeguard.  Amenemhat
is not stern enough to rule Egypt longer, but he offers to assist
with his counsel.]</p>

<p>"Behold thou, [then?] abominable things came to pass when I
was without thee, because the courtiers had not heard that I had
handed on to thee [the kingdom], because I had not sat with
thee [on the throne]. Let me [then] make thy arrangements,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
for I do not confound them.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> I am not ignorant of them, but
my heart does not remember the slackness of servants.</p>

<p><br />9. [The conspiracy was hatched in the palace itself; the commons
were hoodwinked; there was no ground for discontent.]</p>

<p>"Is it the function of women to captain assassins? Is the
interior of a house the nursery of insurgents? Is mining done
by dint of cutting through the snow?<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The underlings were kept
ignorant of what they were doing. Ill fortunes have not come
behind me<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> since my birth; there has not been success like
mine in working to the measure of my ability.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5326" id="Page_5326">[Pg 5326]</a></span></p>

<p><br />10. [Amenemhat's activity.]</p>

<p>"I pushed up to Elephantine and I turned back to Natho;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> I
stood upon the ends of the earth and saw its edge.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> I carried
forward the boundaries of strength-of-arm<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> by my valor and by
my feats.</p>

<p><br />11. [His beneficent rule.]</p>

<p>"I was a maker of barley, beloved of Nepra<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>; the Nile begged
my mercy in every hollow. None were hungry in my years,
none were thirsty therein; the people sat [content] in what they
did, saying with reference to me, 'Every command is in its right
place.'</p>

<p><br />12. [His valor in war and in the chase.]</p>

<p>"I overcame lions, I captured crocodiles. I seized Wawat, I
carried away Mezay; I caused the Setiu to go like hounds.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p><br />13. [The house and tomb that he built.]</p>

<p>"I built a house adorned with gold, its ceiling with blue,<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> its
walls having deep foundations, the gates of copper, the bolts of
bronze, made for everlasting....</p>

<p><br />14. [Usertesen is the sole guardian of its secrets: he is trusted
and beloved by the King and popular in the country.]</p>

<p>"There are numerous intricacies of passages. I know that the
successor will seek its beauties, for he knoweth it not without
thee. But thou art [?] my son Usertesen, as my feet walk;
thou art my own heart as my eyes see, born in a good hour,

<h3><a name="THE_PRISSE_PAPYRUS" id="THE_PRISSE_PAPYRUS"></a>THE PRISSE PAPYRUS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The so-called Prisse Papyrus was obtained at Thebes by the French
artist and Egyptologist who gave it the name by which it is now known. It
is a celebrated document, though as yet but little understood. The language
being difficult and the text in many places corrupt, it is useless to offer a
complete translation. In the following, several passages are omitted altogether,
and the most uncertain portions are italicized, and even of what remains very
little can be guaranteed. The beginning is lost; the first two pages contain
the end of a book of proverbs, the text of which falls naturally into sections,
although it is not divided by rubrics.]</p></div>

<p><br />1. [The first section lays down axioms in regard to discretion
in speech.</p>

<p>"The cautious man succeeds; the accurate man is praised; to
the man of silence the sleeping-chamber is opened. Wide
scope hath he who is acquiescent in his speech; knives
are set against him who forceth his way wrongfully.  <i>Let no
one approach out of his turn.</i>"</p>

<p><br />2. [In regard to food: abstinence.]</p>

<p>"If thou sittest [at meat] with a company, hate the bread
that thou desirest&mdash;it is a little moment. Restrain appetite; gluttony
is base.... A cup of water, it quencheth the thirst; a
mouthful of melon, it stayeth the appetite. It is a good thing to
make substitute for a luxury [<i>or</i>, that which is good can replace
a luxury]; a little of a small matter can replace a great thing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5328" id="Page_5328">[Pg 5328]</a></span>
It is a base fellow who is mastered by his belly, who passeth time
that he wotteth not, free ranging of his belly in their houses."</p>

<p><br />3. [When with a great eater or drinker, offend not by over-abstinence.]</p>

<p>"If thou sittest at meat with a gormandizer and eatest [?],
his desire departeth; if thou drinkest with a toper and takest
wine, his heart is satisfied. Be not afraid of meat in company
with the greedy; take what he giveth thee; refuse it not, for it
will humor him."</p>

<p><br />4. [Against surliness.]</p>

<p>"If there be a man devoid of sociability [<i>lit.</i>, making himself
known], on whom no word hath power, <i>sulky</i> of countenance
to <i>him who would soften</i> the heart <i>by being</i> gracious to him;
he is rude to his mother and to his people, every one [crieth]:
'Let thy name come forth! thou art silent with the mouth when
spoken to.'"<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><br />5. [Against over-confidence in view of the uncertainties of
life.]</p>

<p>"Let not thy heart be proud for valor in the midst of thy
troops. Beware of overbearingness [?]: one knoweth not what
shall happen; what a god will do when he striketh."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[These proverbs were evidently set in a short story, calculated to point the
moral that obedience to wise teaching leads to preferment. The introductory
part has gone with the beginning of the document; but here at the end of
the book there is a passage showing that they were composed by a waz&icirc;r,
<i>i. e.</i>, by the chief administrative official of the kingdom. He read them to
his children; one of whom, it seems, named Kagemni, afterwards succeeded to
the waz&icirc;rship. The following is the translation of this concluding text.]</p></div>

<p>The waz&icirc;r caused his children to be summoned when he had
finished the conduct of men;<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> they rejoiced greatly at coming;
therefore when he said to them:&mdash;"Verily, all things
that are in writing on this roll, obey them as I say [them];<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> do
not pass beyond what is commanded," they [the children] cast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5329" id="Page_5329">[Pg 5329]</a></span>
themselves upon their bellies and read them even as they were
written; they were good within them<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> more than anything that
is in the whole land; their uprising and their downsitting was
according thereto.</p>

city, and waz&icirc;r.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[Huni was the last king of the IIId Dynasty, Seneferu the founder of the

<h3><span class="smcap">The Instruction Of Ptahhetep</span></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[This is another collection of proverbs, in sixteen pages, and with the rubrics
marked. Small fragments from a duplicate copy of this book of proverbs
show considerable variation from the Prisse text, and prove the corruptness
and uncertainty of the latter. It is however quite complete. We are able
to give a list of the contents of the sections, most of which are very brief,
and to append to the headings translations of a considerable proportion of
the whole. Further study will doubtless throw light on much that is still
obscure.</p>

<p>General Title and Introduction: The waz&icirc;r Ptahhetep addresses the King,
and recounts the evils of old age.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Having received the command to take his
son into his office of waz&icirc;r, he desires to teach him the rules of conduct
observed in the time when the gods reigned over Egypt. The King approves,
and bids him commence his instruction.]</p></div>

<h4><i>Instruction of the governor of the royal city, and waz&icirc;r Ptahetep, before
the majesty of King Assa, who liveth forever and ever</i></h4>

<p>The governor of the royal city, and waz&icirc;r Ptahhetep, saith:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O King my lord, years come on, old age befalleth, decrepitude
arriveth, weakness is renewed, he lieth helpless day
by day; the two eyes are contracted, the ears are dull, strength
diminisheth from weariness of heart; the mouth is silent and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5330" id="Page_5330">[Pg 5330]</a></span>
speaketh not, the heart is closed and remembereth not yesterday;
... good becometh evil, all taste departeth; old age is evil
for man in every way: the nose is stopped and breatheth not,
standing and sitting are [alike] weary [?].</p>

<p>"It hath been commanded the servant<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> to make a successor.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
Let me tell unto him the sayings of those who obeyed,<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> the
conduct of them of old, of them who obeyed the gods; would
that the like may be done to thee,<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> that ill may be banished
from among the Rekhyt, and the two lands serve thee."</p>

<p>Said the Majesty of this god:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Teach him according to the words of former days; let him
do what is admirable for the sons of the nobles, so that to enter
and listen unto his words will be the due training of every
heart; and that which he saith shall not be a thing producing
satiety."</p>

<p><br />[Title and aim of the proverbs.]</p>

<p>Beginning of the proverbs of good words spoken by the <i>ha</i>-prince,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
the father of the god who loves the god,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> the King's
eldest son of his body, the governor of the city and waz&icirc;r, Ptahhetep,
as teaching the ignorant to know according to the rule of
good words, expounding the profit to him who shall hearken unto
it, and the injury to him who shall transgress it. He saith unto
his son:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5331" id="Page_5331">[Pg 5331]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><br />1. [Be not proud of thy learning: there is always more to
learn.]</p>

<p>"Let not thy heart be great because of thy knowledge; converse
with the ignorant as with the learned: the boundary of
skill is not attainable; there is no expert who is completely provided
with what is profitable to him: good speech is hidden more
than the emeralds<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> that are found by female slaves on the pebbles."</p>

<p><br />2. [Silence will be the best weapon against a more able debater
than thyself.]</p>

<p>"If thou findest a debater<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> in his moment,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> persuading the
heart<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> as more successful than thyself: droop thy arms, bend thy
back, <i>let not thy heart challenge him; then he will not reach unto
thee.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Be sparing of evil words, as if declining to refute him in
his moment. He will be called ignorant of things, while thy heart
restraineth its wealth.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p><br />3. [Refute the bad arguments of an equal in debate.]</p>

<p>"If thou findest a debater in his moment, thine equal, who is
within thy reach, to whom thou canst cause thyself to become
superior: be not silent when he speaketh evil; a great thing is
the approval of the hearers, that thy name should be good in the
knowledge of the nobles."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p><br />4. [A feeble debater can be left to refute himself.]</p>

<p>"If thou findest a debater in his moment, a poor man, that
is to say, not thine equal, let not thine heart leap out at him
when he is feeble. Let him alone, let him refute himself, question
him not overmuch.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Do not wash the heart<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> of him who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5332" id="Page_5332">[Pg 5332]</a></span>
agreeth with [?] thee: it is painful, despising the poor, ...
thou strikest him with the punishment of nobles."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p><br />5. [A leader of men should use his authority for justice.]</p>

<p>"If thou art a guide, commanding the conduct of a company,
seek for thyself every good aim, so that thy policy may be without
error;[?] a great thing is justice, enduring and surviving<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>; it
is not upset since the time of Osiris; he who departs from the
laws is punished and ... <i>It is the modest</i>[?] <i>that obtain
wealth; never did the greedy</i>[?] <i>arrive at their aim; he saith, 'I
have captured for mine own self;' he saith not, 'I have captured
by [another's'] command.' The end of justice is that it endureth
long; such as a man will say, 'It is from</i> [?] <i>my father.</i>'"</p>

<p><br />6. [Be not a disturber of the peace.]</p>

<p>"Make not terror amongst men;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> God punisheth the like.
There is the man that saith, 'Let him live thereby who is without
the bread of his lips.' There is the man that saith,
'Strong is he who saith, I have captured for myself what I have
recognized.' There is the man who saith, 'Let him smite
another who attaineth, in order to give to him who is in want:'
never <i>did violence among men succeed: what God commandeth
cometh to pass. Then</i><a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> <i>thou mayest live in a palace; pleasure cometh,
and people give things freely.</i>"</p>

<p><br />7. [Behavior to a patron.]</p>

<p>"If thou art a man of those who sit at the place of a greater
man than thyself, take what he giveth <i>with thy hand to thy
nose</i>;<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> thou shalt look at what is before thee; pierce him not
with many glances; it is abomination to the soul for them to be
directed at him. Speak not unto him until he calleth: one knoweth
not the evil at heart [that it causeth]; thou shalt speak when
he questioneth thee, and then what thou sayest will be good to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5333" id="Page_5333">[Pg 5333]</a></span>
the heart. The noble who hath excess of bread, his procedure
is as his soul<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> commandeth; he will give to him whom he praiseth:
it is the manner of night-time.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> It befalleth that it is the
soul that openeth his hands. The noble giveth; it is not that the
man winneth [the gift]. The eating of bread is under the management
of God: it is the ignorant that rebelleth [?] against it."</p>

<p><br />8. [Behavior of a man sent on business from one lord to another.]</p>

<p>"If thou art a man that entereth, sent by a noble to a noble,
be exact in the manner of him who sendeth thee; do the business
for him as he saith. Beware of making ill feeling by words
that would set noble against noble, in destroying justice; do not
exaggerate it; but the washing of the heart shall not be repeated
in the speech of any man, noble or commoner: that is abomination
of the soul."</p>

<p><br />9. [Gain thy living at thy business; do not sponge on relations,
nor hunt legacies.]</p>

<p>"If thou plowest, labor steadily in the field, that God may
make it great in thine hand; let not thy mouth be filled at thy
neighbor's table. <i>It is a great thing to make disturbance of the
silent.</i> Verily he who possesseth prudence is as the possessor of
goods: <i>he taketh like a crocodile from the officials</i>. [?] Beg not as
a poor man of him who is without children, and make no boast
of him. The father is important when the mother that beareth
is wanting, and another woman is added unto her:<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> <i>a man may
produce a god such that the tribe shall pray [to be allowed] to
follow him.</i>"</p>

<p><br />10. [If unsuccessful, take work under a good master; be respectful
to those who have risen in the world.]</p>

<p>"If thou failest, follow a successful man; let all thy conduct
be good before God. When thou knowest that a little man hath
advanced, let not thine heart be proud towards him by reason
of what thou knowest of him; a man who hath advanced, be
respectful to him in proportion to what hath arrived to him;
for behold, possessions do not come of themselves, it is their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5334" id="Page_5334">[Pg 5334]</a></span>
[the gods'] law for those whom they love: verily he who hath
risen, he hath been prudent for himself, and it is God that maketh
his success; and he would punish him for it if he were indolent."</p>

<p><br />11. [Take reasonable recreation.]</p>

<p>"Follow thy heart the time that thou hast; do not more than
is commanded; diminish not the time of following the heart; that
is abomination to the soul, that its moment<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> should be disregarded.
Spend not [on labor] the time of each day beyond what
[is necessary] for furnishing thy house. When possessions are
obtained, follow the heart; for possessions are not made full use
of if [the owner] is <i>weary</i>."</p>

<p><br />12. [Treatment of a son.]</p>

<p>"If thou art a successful man and thou makest a son by
God's grace [?], if he is accurate, goeth again in thy way and
attendeth to thy business on the proper occasion, do unto him
every good thing: he is thy son to whom it belongeth, that thy
<i>Ka</i> begat: estrange not thy heart from him; <i>inheritance</i> [?] <i>maketh
quarrels</i>. [?] If he err and transgress thy way, and refuseth [?]
everything said while his mouth babbleth vain words...."</p>

<p><br />13. [Be patient in the law court.]</p>

<p>"If thou art in the council hall, standing and sitting until thy
going [forward], that hath been commanded for thee on the
earliest day: go not away if thou art kept back, while the
face is attentive to him who entereth and reporteth, and the place
of him who is summoned is broad.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The council hall is according
to rule, and all its method according to measure. It is God
that promoteth position; it is not done to those who are ready of
elbows."</p>

<p><br />14. [Make friends with all men.]</p>

<p><br />15. [Report progress, whether good or evil, to your chief.]</p>

<p><br />16. [A leader with wide instructions should pursue a far-sighted
policy.]</p>

<p><br />17. [A leader should listen to complaints.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5335" id="Page_5335">[Pg 5335]</a></span></p>

<p><br />18. [Beware of women.]</p>

<p>"If thou wishest to prolong friendship in a house into which
thou enterest as master, as brother, or as friend, [in fact in] any
place that thou enterest, beware of approaching the women: no
place in which that is done prospereth. The face is not watchful
in attaining it. A thousand men are injured in order to be
profited for a little moment, like a dream, by tasting which
death is reached."...</p>

<p><br />19. [Keep from injustice or covetousness.]</p>

<p>"If thou desirest thy procedure to be good, take thyself from
all evil: beware of any covetous aim. That is as the painful
disease of colic. He who entereth on it is not successful. It
embroileth fathers and mothers with the mother's brothers, it
separateth wife and husband. It is a thing that taketh to itself
all evils, a bundle of all wickedness. A man liveth long whose
rule is justice, who goeth according to its [the rule's] movements.
He maketh a property thereby, while a covetous man hath no
house."</p>

<p><br />20. [Be satisfied with a fair share.]</p>

<p>"Let not thine heart be extortionate about shares, in grasping
at what is not thy portion. Let not thy heart be extortionate
towards thy neighbors: greater is the prayer to a kindly person
than force. Poor is he that carrieth off his neighbors [by violence]
without the persuasion of words. A little for which there
hath been extortion maketh remorse when the blood<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> is cool."</p>

<p><br />21. [Pay attention to thy wife when thou hast attained a
competence.]</p>

<p>"If thou art successful and hast furnished thine house, and lovest
the wife of thy bosom, fill her belly, clothe her back. The
medicine for her body is oil. Make glad her heart during the
time that thou hast. She is a field profitable to its owner."...</p>

<p><br />22. [Entertain visitors with thy means.]</p>

<p><br />23. [Do not repeat scandal [?].]</p>

<p><br />24. [Talk not of unfamiliar things in the council.]</p>

<p><br />25. [Advice to an able speaker.]</p>

<p>"If thou art strong, inspiring awe by knowledge or by pleasing,
speak in first command; that is to say, not according to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5336" id="Page_5336">[Pg 5336]</a></span>
[another's] lead. The weak man [?] entereth into error. Raise
not thine heart, lest it be cast down. Be not silent. Beware of
interruption and of answering words with heat [?].... The
flames of a fiery heart sweep away the mild man, when a fighter
treadeth on his path. He who doth accounts all day long hath
not a pleasant moment; he who enjoyeth himself all day long
doth not provide his house. The archer will hit his mark even
as he that worketh the rudder, at one time letting it alone, at
another pulling; he that obeyeth his heart [conscience?] shall
<i>command</i>."</p>

<p><br />26. [Do not add to others' burdens.]</p>

<p><br />27. [Teach a noble what will profit him.]</p>

<p><br />28. [Deliver an official message straightforwardly.]</p>

<p><br />29. [Call not to remembrance favors that you have bestowed,
when the recipient has ceased to thank you.]</p>

<p><br />30. [Advice to one that has risen in the world.]</p>

<p>"If thou gainest great after small things and makest wealth
after poverty, so that thou art an example thereof in thy city,
thou art known in thy nome and thou art become prominent: do
not wrap up [?] thy heart in thy riches that have come to thee
by the gift of God,... another like unto thee to whom the
like hath fallen."</p>

<p><br />31. [Obedience to chief.]</p>

<p>"Bend thy back to thy chief, thy superior of the king's
house, on whose property thine house dependeth, and thy payments<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
in their proper place. It is ill to be at variance with the
chief. One liveth [only] while he is gracious."...</p>

<p><br />32. [Against lewdness.]</p>

<p><br />33. [Judge a friend's character at first hand.]</p>

<p>"If thou seekest the character of a friend, mind thou, do not
ask; go to him, occupy thyself with him alone so as not to interfere
with his business. Argue with him after a season, test [?]

what is profitable: profitable to the hearkener is hearkening.
Hearkening is better than anything: it befalleth indeed that love
is good, but twice good is it when a son receiveth what his
father saith: old age cometh to him therewith. He who loveth
God hearkeneth, he who hateth God doth not hearken: it is the

according to what is said. Twice good is it for a son to hearken

A son, he shineth as possessing the quality of hearkening. The

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_MAXIMS_OF_ANY" id="FROM_THE_MAXIMS_OF_ANY"></a>FROM THE 'MAXIMS OF ANY'</h3>

<p>"Keep thyself from the strange woman who is not known in
her city. Look not upon her when she cometh, and know
her not. She is like unto a whirlpool in deep water, the
whirling vortex of which is not known. The woman whose husband
is afar writeth unto thee daily. When none is there to see
her, she standeth up and spreadeth her snare; sin unto death is
it to hearken thereto." Hence he who is wise will renounce her
company and take to himself a wife in his youth. A man's own
house is "the best thing," and also "she will give unto thee a
son who shall be as the image of thyself."...</p>

<p>[Thy debt to thy mother.]<br />
Thou shalt never forget thy mother and what she hath done
for thee, "that she bore thee, and nurtured thee in all ways."
Wert thou to forget her then might she blame thee, "lifting up
her arms unto God, and he would hearken unto her complaint.
For she carried thee long beneath her heart as a heavy burden,
and after thy months were accomplished she bore thee. Three
long years she carried thee upon her shoulder and gave thee her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5341" id="Page_5341">[Pg 5341]</a></span>
breast to thy mouth." She nurtured thee, nor knew offense
from thine uncleanness. "And when thou didst enter the school
and wast instructed in the writings, daily she stood by the master
with bread and beer from her house."</p>

<p>[Be not drunken with beer.]<br />
Drink not beer to excess! That which cometh forth from thy
mouth thou canst no longer speak. Thou fallest down, thou
breakest thy limbs, and none stretcheth out a hand to thee. Thy
companions drink on; they arise and say, "Away with this one
who hath drunken." When one cometh to seek thee, to seek
counsel of thee, he findeth thee lying in the dust like a little
child.</p>

<p>[Of inward piety.]<br />
"Clamor is abhorrent to the sanctuary of God; let thy prayers
for thyself come forth out of a loving heart, whose words remain
secret, that he may grant thee thy needs, may hear thy prayer,
and accept thine offering."</p>

<p>[Of diligence and discretion.]<br />
Be diligent; "let thine eye be open that thou mayest not go
forth as a beggar, for the man who is idle cometh not to honor."
Be not officious and indiscreet, and "enter not [uninvited] into
the house of another; if thou enter at his bidding thou art honored.
Look not around thee, look not around thee in the house
of another. What thine eye seeth, keep silence concerning it,
and tell it not without to another, that it be not in thee a crime
to be punished by death when it is heard." Speak not overmuch,
"for men are deaf to him who maketh many words; but
if thou art silent thou art pleasing, therefore speak not." Above
all be cautious in speech, for "the ruin of a man is on his
tongue. The body of a man is a storehouse, which is full of all
manner of answers. Wherefore choose thou the good and speak
good, while the evil remaineth shut up within thy body."</p>

<p>[Of manners.]<br />
Behave with propriety at table and "be not greedy to fill thy
body." And "eat not bread while another standeth by and thou
placest not thy hand on the bread for him. The one is rich and
the other is poor, and bread remaineth with him who is open-handed.
He who was prosperous last year, even in this may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5342" id="Page_5342">[Pg 5342]</a></span>
a vagrant.[?]" Never forget to show respect, "and sit not down
while another is standing who is older than thou, or who is
higher than thou in his office."</p>

Residence with his son Pepy to take him to the "Court
Writing-School," he admonished him "to set his heart

surpasseth it."  He thereupon composes a poem in praise of <i>the</i>
profession, to the disparagement of all other callings:&mdash;</p>

<p>[The praise of learning was a favorite subject with pedagogue
and parent. According to other sages] "the unlearned
whose name no man knoweth, is like unto a heavy-laden ass,
driven by the scribe," while "he who hath set learning in his
heart" is exempt from labor "and becometh a wise noble."
"The rank of a scribe is princely; his writing outfit and his
papyrus roll bring comfort and wealth." "The scribe alone
guideth the labor of all men; but if labor in writing is hateful
to him, then the goddess of good fortune is not with him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5343" id="Page_5343">[Pg 5343]</a></span></p>

<p>"O scribe, be not lazy, be not lazy, else thou shalt be soundly
chastised; give not thy heart to vain desires, or thou wilt come
to ruin. Book in hand, read with thy mouth, and take the advice
of those who know more than thyself. Prepare for thyself the
office of a noble, that thou mayest attain thereto when thou art
become old. Happy is the scribe clever in all his offices. Be
strong and diligent in daily work. Pass no day idly, or thou
wilt be flogged, for the ears of a boy are on his back, and he
heareth when he is flogged. Let thine heart hear what I say; it
will bring thee to fortune. Be strong in asking advice; do not
overlook it in writing; be not disgusted at it. Therefore let
thine heart hear my words; thou shalt find fortune thereby."</p>

always so dear to the Egyptian.&mdash;Date XIXth Dynasty, or earlier.]</p></div>

<p>It is told to me that thou hast cast aside learning, and givest
thyself to dancing; thou turnest thy face to the work in the
fields, and castest the divine words behind thee.</p>

<p>Behold, thou rememberest not the condition of the fell&acirc;h,
when the harvest is taken over. The worms carry off half the
corn, and the hippopotamus devours the rest; mice abound in the
fields, and locusts arrive; the cattle devour, the sparrows steal.
How miserable is the lot of the fell&acirc;h! What remains on the
threshing-floor, robbers finish it up. The bronze ... are
worn out, the horses [oxen?] die with threshing and plowing.
Then the scribe moors at the bank who is to take over the
harvest;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> the attendants<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> bear staves, the negroes carry palmsticks.
They say, "Give corn!" But there is none. They beat
[the fell&acirc;h] prostrate; they bind him and cast him into the canal,
throwing him headlong. His wife is bound before him, his children
are swung off; his neighbors let them go, and flee to look
after their corn.</p>

<p>But the scribe is the leader of labor for all; he reckons to
himself the produce in winter, and there is none that appoints
him his tale of produce. Behold, now thou knowest!</p>

god" is well known; it would seem to represent a person who stood ceremonially
in the relation of father to a god or person. Thus in later times
we have "fathers" of the god Amen, etc. But at this period "the god"
seems to have meant the King, and the "father of the god" may have been
the guardian or tutor of the King. Some may even see in it the expression
of an actual paternal relationship, as the principles of the succession to the
Egyptian throne are not understood.</p></div>

<h2><a name="JOSEPH_VON_EICHENDORFF" id="JOSEPH_VON_EICHENDORFF"></a>JOSEPH VON EICHENDORFF</h2>

<h4>(1788-1857)</h4>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/capt.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap">he poetry of the Romantic School is the poetry of longing.
It is filled with a spirit of passionate yearning that gives to
it its pathos, and makes each poem seem the expression of
an undefined but ardent wish. The poet's soul is reaching out for
that which no longer is, but which has been and may be again.
Novalis has symbolized this yearning in the quest for the mysterious
"blue flower." Men longed for the glories of the past, and among
the knights and minstrels of medi&aelig;val court and castle they sought
for that blue flower whose odor is love. In the bleak unfriendliness
of the foggy Northern clime, the sunny expansive beauty of the
South, where the magnificence of ancient ages still shimmered through
a mellow haze, drew all sensitive hearts to Italy. Goethe felt the
strong attraction, and fled without leave-taking across the Alps, to
recover his genius under Italian skies. He gave to this deep and
universal longing for Italy its classic incarnation in the pathetic
figure of Mignon. In the very year in which Goethe returned from
Rome, Joseph von Eichendorff was born. He was the last and most
ardent of the Romanticists, and all the restless longing of those times
found in him its typical interpreter.</p>

<p>Eichendorff was born on the family estate at Lubowitz in Silesia,
on March 10th, 1788. He was brought up in the Roman Catholic
faith, to which thereafter so many of his brother poets were converted.
He studied law in Halle, Heidelberg, and Paris. At Heidelberg
he took his degree, and at Heidelberg he came definitely under
the Romantic influence through his association with Arnim, Brentano,
and G&ouml;rres. In Vienna, where he spent three years, he stood in close
relations with Schlegel. His qualities of mind were essentially South
German, for he was an Austrian by birth. He was on the point of
entering the Austrian service when the famous appeal of February
3d, 1813, from the King of Prussia, roused every German patriot.
Eichendorff enlisted as a volunteer in the Prussian army. Throughout
that thrilling campaign of the wars for freedom he fought in the
cause of the wider Fatherland. He became an officer in the "L&uuml;tzow
Corps," which K&ouml;rner has made famous in his verse. Scarcely had
he obtained his dismissal after the first peace of Paris, when the
news of Napoleon's return from Elba summoned him to arms again.
In 1816, however, he began his career, after a brilliant showing
before the examiners, as an officer in the civil service of Prussia.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5346" id="Page_5346">[Pg 5346]</a></span>
Henceforth his life was outwardly uneventful. He married soon after
his appointment. Intellectually he maintained relations with the
finest spirits of his land and time. Having served the State in
various capacities for more than a quarter of a century, he was dismissed
at his own request in 1844, and retired to private life. He
died at Neisse on November 26th, 1857. Heine had died early in the
preceding year. With Eichendorff the last great poet of the Romantic
School passed away.</p>

<p>It would be fruitless to catalogue the works of Eichendorff that are
no longer read. His first independent effort was published at the end
of the Napoleonic campaign, under the title of 'Ahnung und Gegenwart'
(Presage and Presence). Stories, comedies, tragedies, and excellent
translations from the Spanish followed, until now his works fill
ten volumes; but of these, only his poems and his tale 'Out of the
Life of a Good-for-Nothing' retain their full vitality to-day.</p>

<p>His poems possess enduring beauty. They are full of that profound
longing for purer days and fairer realms, and of that dreamy
lyric charm, that makes men young again. There is a breath in
them of a vanished time; they sing of a golden age in which all
men were idle and all women pure. The music of his verse has
attracted many composers, from Mendelssohn, his friend, to Robert
Franz in our own day. Eichendorff looked down upon the rhetorical
ideality of Schiller and the symbolic naturalism of Goethe. He
sang of the soul and its homesickness; of its longing for a lost inheritance.</p>

<p>The delightful 'Life of a Good-for-Nothing' appeared in 1824, and
it remains to-day one of the most popular tales in German literature.
It is the apotheosis of idleness and vagabondism. "In this
little book," says Brandes, "all the old charms of romance are shut
up, as in a cage, to make music for us. There is the odor of the
woods and the song of birds, the longing for travel and the joys of
wandering." The book describes the vagabond life of a child of
genius, idle with a hundred aptitudes, pure with a hundred temptations,
and amid a hundred dangers careless and irresponsible. This
Good-for-Nothing illustrates in his roving life the romantic quest of
the "blue flower." He lives for pure pleasures and the joys of unremunerative
art; his is the infinite longing which never can be
stilled, but only rendered endurable by poetry, by music, and by
moonlight on forest, field, and stream. The book is an exquisite
idyl; it is full of strange adventures and all the romantic machinery
of singular disguises, lofty and secluded castles, and mysterious beauties
who throw flowers from shaded balconies; and yet it is essentially
idyllic, and the beautiful lyrics which are scattered through its pages
create an atmosphere of eternal summer in which we are made to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5347" id="Page_5347">[Pg 5347]</a></span>
forget the work-a-day world where men earn their daily bread and
feel the salutary pressure of duty.</p>

<p>Eichendorff himself was a faithful public servant, and in the
'Life of a Good-for-Nothing' we have the confession only of what
the author perhaps thought he would have liked to be, rather than
of what he was. He was reverent and pious, and one of the most
evenly balanced minds in all that circle of madcap poets. He has
told us of those early days of the Romantic School and of the deep
thrills which agitated the entire German people when Schelling,
Novalis, the Schlegels, and Tieck began their life work in literature.
And this work was done in the days when the sword of Napoleon
hung suspended over Germany: in days when even the poet who
was to sing the praises of the <i>dolce far nicnte</i> of Good-for-Nothingness
was ready to give three years of his life for the defense of his native
land. So far had literature and life lost sight of each other, and the
men of vigorous action and solid achievement still sang sweetly of
the blue flower and of the pleasures of idleness, leaving behind them
a body of literature which, however unreal, will not lose its power to
soothe and charm.</p>

<h3><a name="GOOD_FOR_NOTHING" id="GOOD_FOR_NOTHING"></a>FROM 'OUT OF THE LIFE OF A GOOD-FOR-NOTHING'</h3>

<p>The wheel of my father's mill rushed and roared again right
merrily, the melting snow trickled steadily down from the
roof, the sparrows twittered and bustled about. I sat on
the door-sill and rubbed the sleep out of my eyes; I felt so
comfortable in the warm sunshine. Just then my father came out
of the house. He had worked since daybreak in the mill, and
had his tasseled cap awry upon his head. To me he said:&mdash;"You
Good-for-Nothing! There you are sunning yourself again and
stretching and straining your bones tired, and leave me to do all
the work alone. I cannot feed you here any longer. Spring is
at the door; go out into the world and earn your own bread."
"Now," said I, "if I am a Good-for-Nothing, well and good; I
will go out into the world and seek my fortune." And really
I was very well pleased, for it had shortly before occurred to
me too to travel, when I heard the yellow-hammer, who always
sung his note in autumn and winter so plaintively at our window,
now calling again in the beautiful spring so proudly and merrily
from the trees. I went accordingly into the house and got my
violin, which I played quite cleverly, down from the wall; my
father gave me besides a few groschens to take along, and so I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5348" id="Page_5348">[Pg 5348]</a></span>
sauntered out through the long village. It gave me in truth a
secret pleasure when I saw all my old acquaintances and comrades,
right and left, just as yesterday, and day before yesterday,
and always, going out to work, to dig and to plow; while I thus
wandered out into the free world. I called out to the poor people
on all sides proudly and contentedly, Adieu! but nobody paid
very much attention to it. In my soul it seemed to me like an
eternal Sunday. And when I at last came out into the open
fields, I took up my dear violin and played and sang as I walked
along the highway....</p>

<p>When I presently looked about, a fine traveling carriage came
up quite near to me, that may have been for some time driving
along behind me without my having noticed it, since my heart
was so full of music; for it went along quite slowly, and two
ladies put their heads out of the carriage and listened to me.
The one was particularly beautiful and younger than the other,
but really both of them pleased me. When I now ceased singing,
the elder one had the driver stop and spoke to me kindly:
"Ah, you happy fellow, you know how to sing very pretty songs."
To which I, not at all backward, answered, "If it please your
Excellency, I may have some that are prettier still." Thereupon
she asked me again, "Where then are you wandering so early
in the morning?" Then I was ashamed that I did not know,
myself, and said boldly, "To Vienna." Thereupon both spoke
together in a foreign language that I did not understand. The
younger one shook her head several times, but the other laughed
continuously and finally called out to me, "Spring up behind us:
we are also going to Vienna." Who was happier than I! I made
a bow, and at a jump was on behind the carriage, the coachman
cracked his whip, and we flew along over the glistening road, so
that the wind whistled about my hat.</p>

<p>Behind me disappeared village, gardens, and church towers;
before appeared new villages, castles, and mountains. Below me
grain fields, copse, and meadows flew in many colors past; above
me were countless larks in the blue air. I was ashamed to
cry aloud, but inwardly I exulted, and stamped and danced
about on the footboard of the carriage, so that I had nearly
lost my violin which I held under my arm. As the sun, however,
rose continually higher, and heavy white noonday clouds
came up round about the horizon, and everything in the air and
on the broad plains became so empty and close and still over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5349" id="Page_5349">[Pg 5349]</a></span>
the gently waving grain fields,&mdash;then for the first time came into
my mind my village, and my father, and our mill, and how it
was so comfortable and cool there by the shady pond, and that
now everything lay so far, far behind me. I felt so strangely,
and as if I must turn back again. I put my violin in between
my coat and waistcoat, sat down full of thought upon the footboard,
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes the carriage stood still under tall
linden-trees, behind which a broad stairway led up between columns
into a splendid castle. On one side, through the trees, I
saw the towers of Vienna. The ladies, it appeared, had long
since got out, and the horses were unharnessed. I was much
frightened when I found myself all at once alone. As I sprang
quickly up into the castle, I heard somebody above laughing out
of the window.</p>

<p>In this castle it fared strangely with me. In the first place,
as I was looking about in the wide cool hall, some one tapped
me with a stick upon the shoulder. I turned quickly, and there
stood a great gentleman in court dress, a broad scarf of gold
and silk hanging down to his hips, with a silver-topped staff in
his hand, and an extraordinarily long, hooked, princely nose, big
and splendid as a puffed-up turkey, who asked me what I wanted
there. I was quite taken aback, and for fear and astonishment
could not bring forth a sound. Thereupon more servants came
running up and down the stairs, who said nothing at all, but
looked at me from head to foot. Straightway came a lady's-maid
(as I afterward learned she was) right up to me and said
that I was a charming fellow, and her ladyship desired to ask
me whether I would take service here as a gardener. I put my
hand to my waistcoat. My couple of groschens, God knows,
must have sprung out of my pocket in my dancing about in the
carriage, and were gone. I had nothing but my violin-playing,
for which, moreover, the gentleman with the staff, as he said to
me curtly, would not give a farthing. In my anguish of heart
I accordingly said yes to the lady's-maid, my eyes still directed
from one side to the uncomfortable figure which continually, like
the pendulum of a steeple clock, moved up and down the hall,
and just then again came majestically and awfully up out of
the background. Last of all the head gardener finally came,
growled something to himself about rabble and country bumpkins,
and led me to the garden, preaching to me on the way a long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5350" id="Page_5350">[Pg 5350]</a></span>
sermon&mdash;how I should be sober and industrious, should not rove
about in the world, should not devote myself to unprofitable arts
and useless stuff: in that case I might in time be of some
account. There were still more very pretty, well-put, useful
maxims, only since then I have forgotten almost all of them
again. On the whole, I did not really at all rightly know how
everything had come about. I only said yes continually to everything,
for I was like a bird whose wings had been wet. Thus I
was, God be praised, in possession of my daily bread.</p>

<p>In the garden, life went on finely. I had every day my warm
food in plenty, and more money than I needed for wine,&mdash;only,
alas! I had quite a good deal to do. The temples, too, the
arbors, and the beautiful green walks,&mdash;all that would have
pleased me very well, if I had only been able to walk placidly
about and converse rationally, like the ladies and gentlemen who
came there every day. As often as the head gardener was away
and I was alone, I immediately pulled out my short tobacco
pipe, sat down and thought out pretty polite speeches, such as I
would use to entertain the young and beautiful lady who brought
me along with her into the castle, if I were a cavalier and
walked about with her. Or I lay down on my back on sultry
afternoons, when everything was so still that one could hear the
bees buzzing, and watched the clouds as they floated along to
my own village, and the grasses and flowers as they moved
hither and thither, and thought of the lady; and then it often
happened too that the beautiful lady, with her guitar or a book,
really went through the garden at a distance, as gently, as lofty
and gracious, as an angel, so that I did not rightly know whether
I dreamed or was awake....</p>

<p>Close by the castle garden ran the highway, only separated
from it by a high wall. A very neat little toll-keeper's house
with a red tile roof was built there, and behind it was a little
flower garden, inclosed with a gay-colored picket fence, which,
through a break in the wall of the castle garden, bordered on its
shadiest and most concealed part. The toll-keeper had just died,
who had occupied it all. Early one morning while I still lay in
the soundest sleep, the secretary from the castle came to me and
called me in all haste to the head steward. I dressed myself
quickly and sauntered along behind the airy secretary, who on
the way, now here, now there, broke off a flower and stuck it
on the lapel of his coat, now brandished his cane skillfully in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5351" id="Page_5351">[Pg 5351]</a></span>
air, and talked to the wind all sorts of matters of which I understood
nothing, since my eyes and ears were still full of sleep.
When I entered the office, where it was not yet wholly light, the
steward looked at me from behind a tremendous inkstand and
piles of paper and books and a portly wig, like an owl from her
nest, and began, "What's your name? Where do you come
from? Can you write, read, and cipher?" When I had answered
this affirmatively, he added, "Well, her ladyship designs to offer
you, in consideration of your good behavior and your particular
merits, the vacant toll-keeper's position." I went over quickly
in my mind my previous behavior and manners, and I was
obliged to confess that I found at the end, myself, that the
steward was right. And so I was, then, really toll-keeper, before
I was aware of it.</p>

<p>I moved now immediately into my new dwelling, and in a
short time was settled. I found a number of things that the
late toll-keeper had left behind, among others a splendid red
dressing-gown with yellow dots, green slippers, a tasseled cap,
and some pipes with long stems. All these things I had wished
for when I was still at home, when I always saw our pastor going
about so comfortably. The whole day (I had nothing further to
do) I sat there on the bench before my house in dressing-gown
and cap, smoking tobacco out of the longest pipe that I had
found among those left by the late toll-keeper, and looked at
the people on the highway as they went to and fro, and drove
and rode about. I only wished all the time that people too
out of my own village, who always said that nothing would come
of me all the days of my life, might come by and see me. The
dressing-gown was very becoming to me, and in point of fact all
of it pleased me very well. So I sat there and thought of all
sorts of things: how the beginning is always hard, how a higher
mode of life is nevertheless very comfortable; and secretly came
to the decision henceforth to give up all traveling about, to save
money, too, like others, and in good time surely to amount to
something in the world. In the mean time, however, with all my
decisions, cares, and business, I by no manner of means forgot
the beautiful lady.</p>

<p>The potatoes and other vegetables that I found in my little
garden I threw away, and planted it entirely with the choicest
flowers; at which the janitor from the castle, with the big
princely nose, who since I lived here often came to me and had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5352" id="Page_5352">[Pg 5352]</a></span>
become my intimate friend, looked askance and apprehensively at
me, and regarded me as one whom sudden fortune had made
mad. But I did not allow this to disturb me, for not far from
me in the manor garden I heard low voices, among which I
thought to recognize that of my beautiful lady, although on
account of the thick shrubbery I could see nobody. Then I
bound every day a nosegay of the most beautiful flowers that
I had, climbed every evening when it was dark over the wall,
and placed it on a stone table which stood in the middle of an
arbor, and every evening when I brought the new bouquet the
old one was gone from the table....</p>

<p>I continually felt as I always feel when spring is at hand,&mdash;so
restless and glad without knowing why, as if a piece of great
good fortune or something else extraordinary awaited me. The
hateful accounts, in particular, would no longer get on at all;
and when the sunshine through the chestnut-tree before the
window fell green-golden upon the figures, and added them up
so nimbly from "amount brought forward" to "balance," and
then up and down again, very strange thoughts came to me, so
that I often became quite confused and actually could not count
up to three. For the eight appeared always to me like the stout,
tightly laced lady with the broad hat that I knew, and the
unlucky seven was wholly like a guide-post always pointing backward,
or a gallows. The nine however played the greatest
pranks, in that often, before I was aware of it, it stood itself as
a six merrily on its head; while the two looked on so cunningly,
like an interrogation point; as if it would ask:&mdash;"What shall be
the outcome of all this in the end, you poor naught? Without
her, this slender one-and-all, you will always be nothing!"</p>

<p>Sitting outside before the door, too, no longer pleased me.
I took a footstool out with me, in order to make myself more
comfortable, and stretched out my feet upon it, and I mended
an old parasol of the toll-keeper's and held it against the sun
above me, like a Chinese summer-house. But it did not at all
avail. It seemed to me as I sat thus, and smoked and speculated,
that my legs gradually became longer from very weariness,
and my nose grew from idleness, as I looked down on it for
hours at a time. And when many a time before daybreak an
extra post came by, and I stepped half asleep out into the cool
air, and a pretty little face, of which in the dim light only the
sparkling eyes were to be seen, bent with curiosity out of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5353" id="Page_5353">[Pg 5353]</a></span>
carriage and gave me pleasantly a good-morning, and in the village
round about the cocks crew so freshly out over the gently
waving grain fields, and between the morning clouds high in the
heavens already soared a few too early awakened larks, and the
postilion took his post-horn and drove on, and blew and blew&mdash;then
I stood for a long time still and looked after the coach, and
it seemed to me as if nothing else would do, except to go along
with them, far, far out into the world.</p>

<p>The nosegays I always placed, in the mean time, as soon as
the sun went down, on the stone table in the dim arbor. But
that was just it. That was all over now, since that evening; no
one troubled himself about them. As often as I, early in the
morning, looked after them, the flowers still lay there just as
they did the day before, and looked at me in real sorrow with
their wilted hanging heads, and the dew-drops standing on them
as if they wept. That grieved me very much. I bound no more
nosegays. In my garden the weeds might now flourish as they
would, and the flowers I let stand and grow until the wind blew
away the leaves. My heart was just as waste and wild and disordered....</p>

<p>In these critical times it came to pass that once when I was
lying in the window at home and looking gloomily out into the
empty air, the lady's-maid from the castle came tripping along
the road. When she saw me, she turned quickly toward me and
stood still at the window. "His Lordship returned yesterday
from his journey," said she briskly. "Is it so?" I replied in
astonishment, for for several weeks past I had not concerned
myself about anything, and did not even know that his Lordship
was away. "Then his daughter, the gracious young lady, has
also had, I am sure, a very pleasant time." The lady's-maid
looked at me oddly from top to toe, so that I really was forced
to consider whether I had not said something stupid. "You
don't know anything at all," she finally said, and turned up her
little nose. "Now," she continued, "there is going to be a dance
and masquerade this evening at the castle in his Lordship's
honor. My mistress is also to go in mask, as a flower-girl&mdash;do
you quite understand?&mdash;as a flower-girl. Now my mistress has
noticed that you have particularly beautiful flowers in your garden."
"That is strange," thought I to myself, "since there are
now scarcely any more flowers to be seen on account of the
weeds." But she continued: "As my mistress needs beautiful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5354" id="Page_5354">[Pg 5354]</a></span>
flowers for her costume, but quite fresh ones that have just come
out of the flower-bed, you are to bring her some, and wait with
them this evening, when it has grown dark, under the great
pear-tree in the castle garden. She will come and get the
flowers."</p>

<p>I was quite dumbfounded by this news, and in my rapture
ran from the window out to the lady's-maid.</p>

<p>"Pah! the nasty dressing-gown!" she cried out when she saw
me all at once out-of-doors in my costume. That vexed me. I
did not wish to be behind her in gallantry, and made a few
pretty motions to catch her and kiss her. But unfortunately the
dressing-gown, which was much too long for me, got tangled up
at the same time under my feet and I fell my whole length on
the ground. When I pulled myself together again the lady's-maid
was far away, and I heard her still laughing in the distance;
so that she had to hold her sides.</p>

<p>Now, however, I had something to think about and to make
me happy. <i>She</i> still thought of me and of my flowers! I went
into my garden and quickly pulled all the weeds out of the
flower-beds, and threw them high up over my head away into
the glistening air, as if I drew out with the roots every bit of
evil and melancholy. The roses were again like <i>her</i> mouth; the
sky-blue morning-glories like her eyes; the snow-white lily with
its sorrowfully drooping head looked quite like her. I laid them
all carefully in a little basket together.</p>

<p>It was a still, beautiful evening, with not a cloud in the
heavens. A few stars were already out in the sky; from afar
came the sound of the Danube over the fields; in the tall trees
in the castle garden near me joyfully sang innumerable birds.
Ah, I was so happy!</p>

<p>When night finally came on, I took my little basket over my
arm and set out on my way to the great garden. In my basket
all lay so bright and pretty together&mdash;white, red, blue, and so
fragrant that my heart fairly laughed when I looked in.</p>

<p>Full of happy thoughts, I went along in the beautiful moonlight
through the quiet paths tidily strewed with sand, over the
little white bridges, under which the swans sat sleeping upon
the water, and past the pretty arbors and summer-houses. I had
soon found the great pear-tree, for it was the same one under
which I had lain on sultry afternoons when I was still a gardener.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5355" id="Page_5355">[Pg 5355]</a></span>
Here it was so lonely and dark. Only a tall aspen continually
whispered with its silver leaves. From the castle sounded
now and then the dance music. At times I heard, too, in the
garden human voices, which often came quite near to me, and
then all at once it was again perfectly still.</p>

<p>My heart beat fast. A strange feeling of dread came over
me, as if I intended to steal from somebody. I stood for a long
time stock still, leaning against the tree and listened on all sides;
but as nobody came, I could no longer endure it. I hung my
basket on my arm and climbed quickly up into the pear-tree, in
order to breathe again in the open air....</p>

<p>I now directed my eyes immovably toward the castle, for a
circle of torches below on the steps of the entrance threw a
strange light there, over the sparkling windows and far out into
the garden. It was the servants, who were just then serenading
their young master and mistress. In the midst of them, splendidly
dressed like a minister of state, stood the porter before a
music stand, working hard on his bassoon.</p>

<p>Just as I had seated myself aright in order to listen to the
beautiful serenade, all at once the doors opened, up on the balcony
of the castle. A tall gentleman, handsome and stately in
his uniform and with many glittering stars on his breast, stepped
out upon the balcony, leading by the hand&mdash;the beautiful young
lady in a dress all of white, like a lily in the night or as if the
moon passed across the clear firmament.</p>

<p>I could not turn my glance from the place, and garden, trees,
and fields vanished from my senses; as she, so wondrously illuminated
by the torches, stood there tall and slender, and now
talked pleasantly with the handsome officer and then nodded
kindly down to the musicians. The people below were beside
themselves with joy, and I too could not restrain myself at last,
and joined in the cheers with all my might.</p>

<p>As she however soon afterward again disappeared from the
balcony, and below one torch after the other went out and
the music stands were taken away, and the garden now round
about also became dark again and rustled as before,&mdash;for the
first time I noticed all this,&mdash;then it fell all at once upon my
heart that it was really only the aunt who had sent for me
with the flowers, and that the beautiful lady did not think of
me at all and was long since married, and that I myself was a
great fool.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5356" id="Page_5356">[Pg 5356]</a></span>
All of this plunged me truly into an abyss of reflection. I
wrapped myself up like a hedgehog in the stings of my own
thoughts; from the castle the dance music came more rarely
across, the clouds wandered lonely along over the dark garden.
And so I sat up in the tree, like a night owl, all night long in
the ruins of my happiness.</p>

<p>The cool morning air waked me finally from my dreamings.
I was fairly astonished when I looked all at once about me.
Music and dance was long over, and in the castle and round
about the castle, on the lawn, and the stone steps, and the columns,
everything looked so still and cool and solemn; only the
fountain before the entrance plashed solitarily along. Here and
there in the twigs near me the birds were already awakening
and shaking their bright feathers; and while they stretched their
little wings they looked with curiosity and astonishment at their
strange bedfellow. The joyous beaming rays of morning sparkled
along over the garden upon my breast.</p>

<p>Then I straightened myself out up in my tree, and for the
first time for a long while, once more looked fairly out into the
land, and saw how a few ships were already sailing down the
Danube between the vineyards, and how the still empty highways
swung themselves like bridges across the glistening country,
far out over the mountains and valleys.</p>

<p>I do not know how it came about, but all at once my old
desire to travel seized hold of me again: all the old sadness and
joy and great anticipation. It came into my mind, at the same
time, how the beautiful lady up in the castle was sleeping among
the flowers and under silken coverlets, and an angel was sitting
beside her on the bed in the stillness of the morning.&mdash;"No,"
I cried out, "I must go away from here, and on and on, as far
as the sky is blue!"</p>

<p>And at this I took my basket and threw it high into the air,
so that it was very pretty to see how the flowers lay gayly round
about in the twigs and on the greensward below. Then I
climbed down quickly and went through the quiet garden to my
dwelling. Often indeed I stopped still at many a place where I
had once seen her, or where lying in the shade I had thought of
her.</p>

<p>In and about my house everything still looked just as I had
left it yesterday. The garden was plundered and bare; in my
room inside, the great account-book still lay open; my violin,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5357" id="Page_5357">[Pg 5357]</a></span>
which I had almost wholly forgotten, hung covered with dust on
the wall. A morning beam, however, from the window opposite
fell gleaming across the strings. That struck a true accord
within my heart. "Yes," I said, "do thou come here, thou faithful
instrument! Our kingdom is not of this world!"</p>

<p>And so I took the violin from the wall, left the account-book,
dressing-gown, slippers, pipes, and parasol lying, and wandered,
as poor as I had come, out of my little house away on the glistening
highway.</p>

<p>I still often looked back. A strange feeling had taken possession
of me. I was so sad and yet again so thoroughly joyous,
like a bird escaping from its cage. And when I had gone a long
way I took up my violin, out there in the free air, and sang.</p>

<p>The castle, the garden, and the towers of Vienna had already
disappeared behind me in the fragrance of morning; above me
exulted innumerable larks high in the air. Thus I went between
the green mountains and past cheerful cities and villages down
toward Italy.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">o George Eliot will always have to be assigned a prominent place in
the history of the literature of the nineteenth century as a foremost
novelist, poet, and social philosopher.</p>

<p>Mary Ann, or, as she subsequently spelt her Christian name, Marian,
Evans was born at South Farm, a mile from Griff, in the parish of
Calton in Warwickshire, on November 22d, 1819. Her father, the
prototype of Adam Bede, was Robert Evans, of Welsh origin; who started
life as a carpenter, but soon became a land agent in Warwickshire.
This position implies great responsibilities, and demands thorough
business capacities as well as firmness and trustworthiness of
character, in his relations to his employers as well as his
subordinates. He was intrusted with the management of the extensive
estates of five great noblemen and land-owners in the county of
Warwickshire. He was thus a man of considerable importance and power
in the country, and would hold a social position ranking with the
highest professional classes of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>This position of her father gave her the opportunity of gaining
considerable insight into the lives and characters of English people
of every class in the country, and from its neutral height between the
great landlord and the farmer, down to the farm laborer, she could
command the horizon line of all these lives, realize their habits,
their aspirations and sufferings, and command its extent as well as
its limitations. The country, the fields, the garden about Griff
House, where her childhood was spent, as well as the village with its
inhabitants,&mdash;with whom, through her mother as well as her father, she
came in contact,&mdash;all stimulated her loving and sympathetic
observation and formed that background of experience in the youthful
mind, out of which subsequently rose, with strong spontaneity and
truthful precision of design, the characters and scenes of her novels.
They will ever remain the classical expositions of English provincial
life in literature. The upright strength and pertinacity of her
characters, as well as the insight into practical life and the life of
men, were no doubt derived from her father, and from the intimate
intercourse with him for so many years of the most important formative
period of her life.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5360" id="Page_5360">[Pg 5360]</a></span>
Her mother was a housewife of the old-fashioned type, whose health was
always poor, and who died when Marian was about fifteen years of age.
She is supposed to be portrayed in Mrs. Hackit in 'Amos Barton.' She
seems to have been a woman with ready wit, a somewhat sharp tongue, an
undemonstrative but tender-hearted nature. In many respects she seems
also to have been the model for that masterpiece of character-drawing,
Mrs. Poyser. Though Marian had two sisters, her brother Isaac Evans
was her playmate. The youthful relation between brother and sister was
very much like that of Tom Tulliver and Maggie in 'The Mill on the
Floss,'&mdash;no doubt the most autobiographical of her novels, as regards
at least the drawing of Maggie's character.</p>

<p>Marian was at first sent to a school at the neighboring Nuneaton; and
at a very early age she taught at Sunday school,&mdash;which may have
instilled a magisterial bias into her mind from the very outset. At
the age of twelve she proceeded to a school at Coventry, kept by the
Misses Franklin, which enjoyed considerable reputation in the
neighborhood. She remained in this school for three years; beyond
elementary school duties she devoted much time to English composition,
French and German. Her life was then rather solitary, moved by strong
inner religious convictions, upon which she dwelt with passionate
fervor. Her religious views were at first simply those of the Church
of England, then those of the Low Church, and then became
"anti-supernatural." The second phase was no doubt strongly influenced
by her aunt, Mrs. Elizabeth Evans, the "Derbyshire Methodist," the
prototype of Dinah Morris in 'Adam Bede.' The earnest, almost
lugubrious conception of life which she formed in these times, and
which subsequent years and experiences only intensified, no doubt gave
the keynote to her whole temperament and genius. It produced in her
that supreme development of the idea of duty and compassion for human
suffering which elevates the tone of her writing with a lofty
conception of life, enables her to penetrate into the feelings and
aspirations of all classes, and while it widened the range of her
sympathy, never did so at the cost of genuineness or intensity of
feeling. At the same time this serious keynote, though it was not
opposed to humor,&mdash;the growth of which it even favored,&mdash;led to some
limitations in the harmonious development of her artistic nature;
notably in that it counteracted the sense for the playful and joyous
side of life. The eternal conflict between Hellenism and Hebraism,
between the vine-wreath and the crown of thorns, was not reconciled by
her, but led to the suppression or defeat of Hellenism. The true, the
joyous spirit of Hellenism, with its ideals of beauty and happiness in
life, never really possessed her soul. In her own words she has put
this eternal dualism:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Only in the tragic manifestation of the Greek mind, above all in
an &AElig;schylus, did she find true resonance to the passionate beats of
her God-loving and world-renouncing heart. Yet more and more, as
her mind grew and severed itself from the traditional beliefs of her
childhood,&mdash;with which however she ever remained in deepest sympathy,&mdash;did
this love of God and renunciation of the world mean the
love of man and the tolerance of weakness, the pity with suffering
and the active effort to help to rectify and to improve. The one
element in Hellenism which she adopted and clung to, and which as
a supporting wall she added to the whole structure of her more
Hebraistic beliefs and ideals, was the worship of Sanity. This worship
only intensified the tolerance of the unsound, the pity for the
diseased and distorted and miserable. And though she never became
a professed Positivist, it was no doubt the response which Comte's
philosophy gave to these cravings that made his views ultimately
most congenial to her.</p>

<p>The true and independent development of her mind began when
after the death of her mother she took charge of Griff House for her
father; but especially when in 1841 her father retired from his active
duties, and settled at Foleshill near Coventry. It was here, while
taking lessons in Latin and Greek from Mr. Sheepshanks, and also
devoting herself to music, that she formed the friendship with Mr.
and Mrs. Charles Bray of Coventry and their kinsman Mr. Charles
C. Hennell, the Unitarian philosopher and writer. These people,
deeply interested in philosophy and literature, and important contributors
to the philosophico-religious literature of the day, responded
fully to the mental needs of George Eliot. Out of this intellectual
affinity grew a friendship which lasted through life. They also introduced
her to the philosophical and critical literature of Germany,
and it was through them that she began in 1843 her first literary
task, the translation of David Strauss's 'Life of Jesus,' which had
been begun by Miss Brabant, who became Mrs. Charles Hennell.
The task of translating Strauss's great work, which occupied three
years of her life, was followed by work of the same nature, which,
though not as taxing as the life of Christ, must still have called upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5362" id="Page_5362">[Pg 5362]</a></span>
thought and perseverance to a high degree: it was 'The Essence of
Christianity,' by the German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. These
works, which stand on the border line between philosophy and religion,
led her by a natural development into the domain of pure philosophy;
so that the next more extensive task which she undertook,
but to our knowledge never completed, was a translation of Spinoza's
'Ethics.'</p>

<p>She was now fairly, at the age of twenty-seven, launched in her
literary career; though as yet it was on the side of science and
religion and not of art. The essays which belong to the following
period, together with her editorial occupation, again formed a transition
from the more scientific character of her writing to the domain
of pure literature. And though these works belong to the field of
criticism, it was criticism as applied to pure literature, fiction, and
biography, and thus brought her inherently ponderous and theoretical
mind, by natural stages, from analysis and speculation to the more
imaginative sphere of synthesis and creation. This early theoretical
and scientific direction of her occupation and thought may have produced
that fault in her later writing with which she has often been
reproached,&mdash;it may have made her style and diction clumsy and
pedantic. On the other hand, it was a most excellent training for
the future writer of even fiction. For it exercised the mind in gaining
full mastery over thought; in recognizing and defining the nicest
and most delicate shadings of meaning and of expression; in insisting
upon their logical sequence, and thus impressing upon the author the
rudiments of exposition and composition; in extending and enriching
the domain of knowledge and fact; and finally, in producing and
training the force of <i>intellectual</i> sympathy, which sharpens as well as
intensifies insight into life and character, and gives to the mind that
pliancy which directs the feeling heart to beat in sympathy with all
forms of experiences, desires, and passions,&mdash;however far the lives
and personalities may be removed from the author who constructs or
describes them.</p>

<p>In 1849 the death of her father threw her into a state of deepest
depression. It was then that her kind friends the Brays took her for
a tour on the Continent, to Italy and Switzerland. She remained at
Geneva in the family of the artist D'Albert for eight months, where
she no doubt found congenial local associations; for the shores of the
Lake of Geneva, haunted by the spirits of Calvin, Rousseau, Voltaire,
Madame de Sta&euml;l, Gibbon, Byron, and Shelley, seem bound up with
world-stirring thought as no other place in Europe. Upon her return
to England she made her home with the Brays at Rosehill for about
a year, and then accepted the offer of Dr. John Chapman to become
sub-editor of the Westminster Review and to make her home in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5363" id="Page_5363">[Pg 5363]</a></span>
family. She here entered a circle of the most prominent literary
men and women of the day, and among these she became an intimate
friend of Herbert Spencer, John Oxenford, James and Harriet
Martineau, George Henry Lewes, and others. Emerson she had met
before at Rosehill. Besides her arduous sub-editorial work, she contributed
several remarkable papers to the Review. Among these are:
'Carlyle's Life of Sterling' and 'Margaret Fuller' in 1852; 'Women
in France: Madame de Tabl&eacute;,' 1854; 'Evangelical Teaching: Dr.
Cumming,' 1855; 'German Wit: Heinrich Heine,' 'Silly Novels by
Lady Novelists,' 'The Natural History of German Life,' 1856; 'Worldliness
and Otherworldliness: the Poetry of Young' in 1857.</p>

<p>It was in 1854 that occurred the great event in her life; she joined
George Henry Lewes as his wife, though the latter's wife was still alive.
Lewes was separated from his first wife, though circumstances made
it impossible for him to get a divorce. From that moment George
Eliot remained the most faithful and devoted wife to Lewes and
mother to his children, until his death in 1878. She united her life
with that of Lewes after due and full deliberation, and with a thorough
weighing of consequences and duties. But that she felt the
deepest regret in that her complete union was not in accordance with
the established laws of the society in which she lived, is evident
from all her letters and writings; and though it need not have led
to her marriage with her late husband Mr. Cross, the opportunity
afforded of showing her respect to the established rules of matrimonial
life must certainly have made it easier for her to form a new
alliance, after the death of her first husband.</p>

<p>With Lewes she went to Germany, living for some time at Berlin
and Weimar, while he was writing his 'Life of Goethe' and she was
working at her translation of Spinoza's 'Ethics' and was contributing
some articles on German literature. Upon their return they settled
in London, finally in the Priory, North Bank, in the northwest of the
metropolis, which was for many years a <i>salon</i> of the London literary
world. The Sunday afternoons of this remarkable couple united all
the talent and genius, residents or foreign visitors. One might meet
in one and the same afternoon Charles Darwin, Robert Browning,
Tennyson, Richard Wagner, Joachim the violinist, Huxley, Clifford,
Du Maurier, and Turg&eacute;nieff. Lewes, the most brilliant and versatile
conversationalist of his day, gave life and freedom to these meetings;
but the intellectual and moral centre always remained George Eliot,
with her soft, sweet voice, her clear intonation, her friendly and
encouraging smile, lighting up as by a contrast the earnestness of
her serious and large features, which resembled those of Savonarola,
whose character she has drawn in such strong lines in 'Romola.'
But the quality of searching sympathy and benignant humor, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5364" id="Page_5364">[Pg 5364]</a></span>
remarkable in her writings, gave the warmth of kindness and cordiality
to these formidably intellectual meetings. The present writer remembers
with grateful piety how, when he was a very young man
struggling to put a crude thought into presentable form before these
giants of thought and letters, she would divine his meaning even in
its embryonic uncouthness of expression, and would give it back to
him and to them in a perfect and faultless garb; so that in admiring
and worshiping the woman, he would be pleased with his own
thoughts and would think well of himself. It is this sympathetic and
unselfish helpfulness of great and noble minds, which gives confidence
and increases the self-esteem of all who come in contact with them.
No wonder that one often saw and heard of a great number of people,
young girls or young men, who by letter or in person sought
help and spiritual guidance from her, and went away strengthened by
her sympathy and advice.</p>

<p>Her first attempt at fiction was made when in her thirty-seventh
year, in September 1856. The account of this is best shown in her
own words here given among the extracts from her writings. Her
first story was a short one, called 'The Sad Fortunes of the Rev.
Amos Barton.' This was followed by 'Mr. Gilfil's Love Story' and
'Janet's Repentance,' and soon there was that remarkable volume
called 'Scenes of Clerical Life.' Lewes and she and the world all
realized that she was a true novelist, and from that moment she
directed all her energies to the production of those works which will
ever live, in spite of all changes of fashions and modes of story-telling,
classical specimens of English fiction. In rapid succession
now followed 'Adam Bede' in 1858; 'The Mill on the Floss' in 1860;
'Silas Marner' in 1861; 'Romola' in 1863; 'Felix Holt, the Radical,'
in 1866; the poem 'The Spanish Gypsy' in 1868; 'Jubal and Other
Poems' in 1870; 'Middlemarch' in 1872; 'Daniel Deronda' in 1876;
and her last work, 'The Impressions of Theophrastus Such,' which
was not published till after the death of Lewes, which occurred in
1878. She married Mr. Cross in May, 1880. She died on December
22d, 1880.</p>

<p>To lead to the fuller understanding of George Eliot's works, it was
necessary to sketch in broad outlines the growth of her life and personality.
As a writer she was not only a novelist but also a poet,
and above all a social philosopher. Her ethical bias is so strong,
moreover, that one cannot understand her as a novelist or a poet
unless one has grasped her social philosophy and the all-pervading
and ever-present influence it has upon her mind and writing.</p>

<p>In her delineation of character and depiction of scenes, especially
those of rural and domestic life, truthful rendering is to her the
supreme duty; and one need but open the 'Scenes of Clerical Life,'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5365" id="Page_5365">[Pg 5365]</a></span>
'Adam Bede,' 'The Mill on the Floss,' 'Silas Marner,' and 'Middlemarch,'
on any page, to realize the fullness of truth with which she
has painted. At the time of their appearance, not only were the persons
and the environment identified with the originals she had in her
mind, but as lasting types they tallied exactly with people and local
life known to each English reader. This truthful rendering was also
conceived by her as a primary duty of the novelist. We would refer
the reader to what, in an essay, she says of the English peasant in
fiction, and would recall her own words in the same essay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A picture of human life, such as a great artist can give, surprises even
the trivial and the selfish into that attention to what is apart from themselves,
<i>which may be called the raw material of sentiment</i>....  Art is
the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending
our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot. All
the more sacred is the task of the artist when he undertakes to paint the life
of the people. Falsification here is far more pernicious than in the more
artificial aspects of life."</p></div>

<p>Another interesting passage is one containing an estimate of Dickens,
in which she considers the Oliver Twists, Joes, and Nancys
terrible and pathetic pictures of London life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And if Dickens had been able to give us their psychological character,
their conception of life, and their emotions, with the same truth as their
idiom and manners, his books would be <i>the greatest contribution to art
ever made to the awakening of social sympathies</i>."</p></div>

<p>George Eliot might thus be classified as one of the greatest if not
the greatest realist of the analytical or psychological order. But this
would, to our mind, be a one-sided and incomplete estimate of the
chief character in her writing and genius. Truthful rendering of life
and character may have been one of the chief motives to composition,
and a fundamental requisite to the art of her fiction; but it
remained a means to a further end&mdash;the ultimate end&mdash;of her writing,
as it no doubt was the fundamental stimulus to her imagination
and design. And this end and motive make her an idealist and not
a realist in fiction. The direction in which this idealism goes we
have indicated in the lines we have italicized in the passages we
quote from her, and is to be found in the ethical motive below and
beyond all her thought and composition, the predominance of the
social philosophy in her fiction and poetry, to which we have already
referred.</p>

<p>We will dismiss the coarse and caricatured distinction between
realism and idealism, in which the one is supposed to render truthfully
<i>whatever is</i>, without any principle of selection or composition;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5366" id="Page_5366">[Pg 5366]</a></span>while the other starts with preconceived notions of the <i>ought to be</i>,
be it from the point of view of formal beauty or spiritual harmony,
and proves the facts that are. Art, and the novel above all,&mdash;which
deals with life at once so clear and familiar to us, and so perplexingly
manifold and varied as constantly to elude choice and design,&mdash;can neither
forego truth nor unity of design.</p>

<p>But in the novelist's attitude towards human life there are two
distinct points of view from which a new classification of novelists
might be made: the position given to ethics, the moral laws in the
presentation of life. The laws of human conduct are so essential to
the relation of man to man, that the fundamental question as to
what position ethics holds in our narrative cannot be ignored. The
novelist must have decided whether he is going to consider its
claims in the primary structure of his novel, and in the creation and
development of characters, or not. Is he going to prepare the
groundwork of artistic labor with a view to ethical design, or pure
artistic design? It may be said that the best work requires both.
But still, in so far as the one is heeded more than the other, will
the writer be an idealist or a realist in this sense.</p>

<p>The idealist will focus his view of the characters, their experiences
and sufferings and surroundings, from a view of moral fitness
and design; the realist will find the design and composition, the harmony
which all art needs, in the characters, in the scenes, in the
life itself, and the inner organic relation of the parts to the whole.
The one leads to the best idealism, the other to the best realism.
The one produces a George Eliot, the other a Guy de Maupassant.
This realist ignores the general fitness of things, the moral law, and
says:&mdash;"This character is interesting in itself, this situation is amusing,
curious, striking, or terrible,&mdash;they are worth depicting, without
any question as to their relation to social or moral ideals." Guy de
Maupassant takes characters and situations and depicts them with
consummate art; he never troubles himself about general moral fitness,
&mdash;we never know what his moral and social ideals are, nor
whether he has any at all. Jane Austen is interested in her characters,
in the tone and range of ideas of the period and the society in
which she lives, the types of life, and she draws them with consummate
art; but though we are left in no doubt in her case as to the
good and the bad, and though the good generally prevails and the bad
is defeated, these are not subordinated to a clear conception of an
ideal social order, without which the characters and the story could
not have been conceived and developed&mdash;as is always the case with
George Eliot. Gwendolen Harleth, Felix Holt, Maggie, Dorothea,
Lydgate, the life and surroundings of these figures, all bear a fixed
relation to the social ideals of the author; and it is in this relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5367" id="Page_5367">[Pg 5367]</a></span>that she conceives and develops them. Nay, it is for the purpose
of illustrating and fixing this that she creates them at all. Strange
as it may sound, in so far Jane Austen might be called a realist and
be classed with Guy de Maupassant; while George Sand, with whom
she has so much similarity of spirit, is by contrast an idealist. It is
a difference in the initial methods of dealing with life in fiction.</p>

<p>It is not enough for George Eliot to present an interesting character,
to follow up its fate and growth, to force the reader into sympathy,
to make him hope for success or fear failure; nor even to
show the struggle with the surroundings, to depict interesting and
complex situations and centres. Her writings always depend upon a
primary postulate, and to this postulate all characters, scenes, and
situations are ultimately subordinated. This postulate is: The ideal
social order as a whole, the establishment of sane and sound social
relations in humanity, the development and progress of human society
towards such an ideal of general human life. All characters and situations,
all scenes of life, whether clerical or provincial, whether of
the present or of the past (and this may here be a grave fault), are
developed and viewed by her in their relation to this general standard
of ideal society; how far they fit into this general harmony, and
failing this, how far they can in her stories be made to fit more fully;
or they are left to a more tragic end which emphasizes the facts
of their unfitness. Herein lies her distinctive character as a novelist,
a point in which her delineation differs from most of the other great
novelists&mdash;from a Balzac and a Flaubert, a George Sand, a Thackeray,
and a Dickens, a Turg&eacute;nieff and an <i>early</i> Tolstoy. I do not mean to
say that these novelists had not a social ideal at the foundation of
their constructive imagination; but it did not play that essential part
in their conception and working out of characters and plots, it was
not ever present in their minds while they were describing characters,
feelings, incidents, and situations, as it appears to have been
with George Eliot. Her philosophical and ethical bias thus manifests
itself, in that there was an idea of general social fitness and happiness
modifying and directing her representation of individual life and
character.</p>

<p>To understand this social ideal of a rational and essentially sane
world, we must conceive her as an expression of the spirit of the age
out of which she grew. And she will thus hold a place not only as a
novelist, but as a pregnant and significant exponent of the thought of
the third quarter of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The time in which her mind was formed is marked on the side of social
ethics, in that a broad and powerful humanitarian wave spread over
English life and thought. Negatively it manifested itself in that it
was a period of storm and stress toward the birth of
tolerance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5368" id="Page_5368">[Pg 5368]</a></span>&mdash;tolerance with all forms of belief and even unbelief. In
the English Church itself, it was the period of clear accentuations of
shades of belief that differed to a very marked degree from one
another. The Church of Rome was brought nearer to the Anglican
believer, and was robbed of its Apocalyptic horrors by a Newman and a
Manning; a definite political act was the Irish Church Act. But an
especial feature of this tolerance was the social recognition of
agnosticism, in its scientific aspect through a Darwin, and in its
more ethical aspect through a Mill, a Herbert Spencer, and a Matthew
Arnold; while divines of the English Church itself, like Stanley,
Maurice, Kingsley, and Jowett, bridged over the gaps between dogmatism
and agnosticism. The repeal of the Test Act (according to which the
signing of the Thirty-nine Articles was a condition for obtaining a
scholarship or fellowship) abolished all disqualifications from
freethinkers at the great universities. Quakers and Jews had before
been admitted to Parliament, and now took prominent and leading
places.</p>

<p>But more positively, the philosophy of Auguste Comte with its English
exponents, especially Mill, impressed the religious feeling of
humanitarianism. There had been a wave of this before, a wave the
commotion of which was felt even in our days. It was the
humanitarianism of Rousseau, under which George Sand stood. But this
differs in a marked manner from that of our friend. With Rousseau it
was <i>deductive</i>, based upon the inalienable rights of man, of the
individual,&mdash;a deductive sociology. In our times it was essentially
guided by the prevailing spirit and methods of thought of Charles
Darwin, Mill, Herbert Spencer, Huxley, Clifford, and Matthew Arnold,
with the regenerated and refined sense of truth which they have given
to the world. It has thus led to an <i>inductive</i> sociology and
inductive humanitarianism, freed from all romantic character and
admixture, essentially sober and sane, though none the less passionate
and deep-seated. The last wave of Rousseauesque feeling filtered
through German sources to us in Carlyle and Ruskin. But this mode of
thought was foreign to George Eliot. She disliked all forms of
exaggeration.</p>

<p>She has always clear in her mind the sane and sober ideals of a
society based upon the truthful observation and recognition of its
wants and needs. The claims of truth, the claims of charity and
unselfishness, are supreme. To this ideal the individual must
subordinate himself if he wishes to be happy and noble, beloved and
honored; must have "that recognition of something to be lived for
beyond the mere satisfaction of self, which is to the moral life what
the addition of a central ganglion is to animal life."</p>

<p>Pure applied psychology and knowledge of the <i>coeur humain</i>, which
have actuated so many great novelists,&mdash;the careful and studied
development of an individual life and character as such within its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5369" id="Page_5369">[Pg 5369]</a></span>surroundings,&mdash;were not enough to absorb the desires of George
Eliot's efforts in fiction; still less mere striking incidents, and
the engrossing consequences and sequences as they push on in the plot
of a story; but the <i>coeur humain</i> and incidents in life are viewed in
their relation to society as a whole, to social ideals. She is thus an
idealistic and an ethical novelist.</p>

<p>Even in her poetry this bias manifests itself; and here, from an
artistic point of view, the effect is often more disturbing than in
her novels. For in poetry the purely artistic, emotional, and lyrical
aspect is more important and essential; and any general and impersonal
ideal counteracts the reality of the characters, the mood, and the
passion. Thus in her longest and greatest poem, 'The Spanish Gypsy,'
the feelings and expressions put into the mouth of Fedalma and Zarca
are the nineteenth-century thoughts and feelings of a George Eliot,
and lose their immediate truthfulness and convincing power from being
thus expressed by fictitious persons; while the personalities
themselves, their thoughts and feelings, do not strike one with a
sense of reality, because they express views which sound anachronistic
and have not their proper local coloring. In spite of some beautiful
shorter poems, passages, and lines, she fails when criticized as a
lyrical poetess; nor will her poems stand faultless when judged from
the epic point of view. But if there be any justification (which we
hold there is) for didactic poetry,&mdash;poetry which calls in artistic
emotion to impress truths and moral laws,&mdash;then she will always hold a
prominent place in this sphere. 'Stradivarius' and the 'Positivist
Hymn' will, together with Matthew Arnold's 'Self-Dependence,' rank
among the finest types of didactic poems of our age.</p>

<p>Though at times her ethical bias has obtruded itself out of place, and
may have counteracted her certainty of touch in drawing lifelike
character (as for instance in the construction of Daniel Deronda's
personality), it has, on the whole, not prevented her from giving full
play to her marvelous power of clear and deep insight into life and of
sensuous description.</p>

<p>In studying life she had learned observation in the scientific
inductive school, and had thus acquired, with minuteness of
perception, the clear-sighted and unprejudiced intellectual justice of
vision which enabled her to appreciate fully and to grasp the inner
core of all the characters, motives, and passions which her command
over her thoughts and language and her docile pen enabled her to fix
in so masterly a manner. But these faculties would not have been
enough to lead to her creation of human types, had she not possessed
to that intense and exalted degree the power of feeling which gave the
initial stimulus to her penetration of the human heart and its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5370" id="Page_5370">[Pg 5370]</a></span>motives and passions, and which her intellectual control converted
into all-encompassing and all-pervading sympathy. She was, after all,
what Elizabeth Browning expressed in the pregnant phrase&mdash;"a
large-brained woman and a large-hearted man."</p>

<p>Nay, this sympathy was so intense and leading a feature of her genius
that it again serves to establish a distinct general classification of
novelists. Like great actors, great writers of fiction may be
classified, according to their mode of rendering the life they study,
as subjective and objective interpreters. The former are
intellectually so wide and emotionally so responsive, that their great
souls and minds grasp and assimilate, absorb for the time being, all
the different natures which they portray; they thrill with them&mdash;they
become them. The objective artists possess more the painter's and
sculptor's attitude of mind; they eliminate self completely during the
period of observation, and enter, through the fullness and delicacy of
their perceptions, into the lives and characters they depict. For the
time they see only the object of their study, and reproduce it with
clear and dispassionate touch. This is the case with Balzac,
Turg&eacute;nieff, Thackeray, and Dickens. The objective method is the safest
and least likely to produce faults in drawing which make the
characters at times inconsistent and fall out of their parts; but the
subjective method may at times attain depth of insight, and fullness
of passion and veracity, which lies hidden from the dispassionate
draughtsmen and impersonators. The Bront&eacute;s had this subjective
penetration to the highest degree; but they had not, on the other
hand, the inductive and scientific training of George Eliot, which
sobered down and made more objective, as it made more humorous, the
sympathetic impersonations in her stories. Above all, the purely
emotional subjectivity of George Eliot was counteracted by the passion
for the general ethical and the social ideal which we have already
considered as playing so essential a part in her mind. Upon this we
must take our stand in order to appreciate her leading method of
composition, which can be traced, we venture to believe, through all
her novels.</p>

<p>Starting with a well-defined ideal of social fitness for this world,
the harmony in life towards which all action, effort, and
individuality must tend, the problem which each novel sets itself to
solve is the reconciliation of the conflict arising out of the
unfitness of the leading characters (the "hero" or "heroine," as we
may call them) as measured by this ideal&mdash;the want of harmony between
their characters, aspirations, and ambitions, their views of life, and
on the other hand the surroundings in which they live. The Greek
tragedians, Shakespeare, and all great dramatists, have ever dealt
with this central struggle between man and society. But they started
with this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5371" id="Page_5371">[Pg 5371]</a></span>fact, and had merely the artistic aim of evoking sympathy
and pity in the audience because of this tragic struggle, the powerful
and perfect representation of which became the final aim of their
artistic endeavor. With George Eliot the process of adaptation, the
resolution of the discord, and if not the establishment of harmony,
then the clear and impressive indication of the best way to its
establishment, is the real motive and end of her writing. There is in
her no great tragic fatalism, which makes the art of the Greek
dramatist so deeply and overwhelmingly tragic. Each one of her leading
characters is at fault, when viewed in the light of the healthy social
ideal. In the exposition of the character the fault will be shown up
strongly; the hero will either be developed into greater social
perfection, or the tragic end will impress upon the reader the disease
and its remedy, the bane and its antidote.</p>

<p>The social failings and shortcomings which stand in the way of this
harmony are grouped by her into two leading faults of a general
nature: the discord between the individual and selfish and the general
and altruistic; between thoughtless social materialism and conformity,
and questioning originality and spiritual revolt; between
conventionality and originality; between common-sense and prophetic
far-sightedness; between the Philistine and the artistic, the humdrum
worker and the world-reformer, the materialist and the dreamer. The
one looks down before him on the ground and ignores the heights beyond
and the clear sky above, and in his heavy-footed advance shoves the
sky-gazer aside and walks over him when he has fallen; the other gazes
at the heights and the stars, and spurns the clod and soil, tripping
over them,&mdash;nay, slipping in the mud. They each ignore one another and
the world in which each lives, or they despise each other and their
respective goals and aims.</p>

<p>Now, in all her novels this problem is repeated and a solution is
attempted. Over and over again she presents this situation as the
central point in the composition of her novels, in different layers of
society, in most varied characters. And the understanding of this is
the key to the understanding of George Eliot's works. She either
brings it out in presenting two central figures as the contrasts which
represent either faulty extreme, or one figure as opposed to the
surroundings, or both these means are used to impress the central
fact.</p>

<p>We shall take one pregnant instance to illustrate this: 'Daniel
Deronda' has been estimated and criticized chiefly as a novel in which
the Jewish question has been discussed by her in a dramatic manner.
That it deals powerfully with this question is no doubt true; but the
Jewish question is but a side issue&mdash;no doubt appealing to her deep
sympathies and sense of justice; but it is not the central motive to
the story nor the artistic keystone of the novel as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5372" id="Page_5372">[Pg 5372]</a></span>constructed. The
central figure in that story is Gwendolen Harleth (who ought properly
to have given her name to the novel). The contrasting figure at the
other extreme is Mordecai the Jew, and Daniel is the intermediary
figure (almost figure-head) between these two extremes. The
personality which, I am sure, set her sympathetic intellect and
imagination throbbing into artistic creation was Gwendolen. As an
ordinary though beautiful young lady of English society (in her rank
what Hetty Sorrel and Rosamond Vincy are in theirs), she is the
clod-born, materialistic, and hopelessly selfish representative of the
unsocial member of a society in which ideas and ideals are unknown,
and in which blind impulse, feebly directed by prejudice and
tradition, petty vanity and greed, at most personal ambition, are the
motives to action, and produce the discord and misery which surround
even those who live in affluence. Her beauty, her position in her
family, her whole education, have kept from her every higher ideal,
all semblance of an ideal, and all altruism and feeling for or with
her fellow-men. Her world in the opening of the story is the most
contracted world of a small self, with a pervading passion out of all
proportion to its extent, in which the desires whirl round and round
this little circle in hideous compression. Now the fundamental problem
of the story is: How can this little, selfish, and materialistic
nature, which only realizes the things before its desiring eyes and
grasping touch, be made large, unselfish, and idealistic, so that it
reaches out beyond and above the world of self into the regions of
great ideas, in which the individual is completely submerged; and that
through this wholesome straining of the heart and of sympathetic
power, through this realization and love of the ideal, it may learn to
love and pity, and think for and in, mankind and all men and women?
And this process of artistic development of character is sensuously
and convincingly represented in this novel. The reader enters
sympathetically into the little soul of that beautiful girl at the
very beginning of the story, and in her he passes through all the
phases, until without any forced hiatus he sees before him at the end
the purified and enlarged Gwendolen, who has learnt her ennobling
lesson in the great school of suffering. It is perhaps the greatest
achievement in her art.</p>

<p>The more definite question is: How can such a girl realize the great
world of ideas? The answer is: It must come through the heart, through
the emotions and not the intellect,&mdash;the intellect will be widened and
matured after her personality has been thrilled. She must fall in love
with a man who is the impersonation of an idea, whose whole existence
centres round a great desire far removed from the petty world of self
in which she has lived,&mdash;nay, opposed to it, in direct contrast to it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5373" id="Page_5373">[Pg 5373]</a></span></p>

<p>This impersonation is presented in Daniel Deronda; and the fault in
the book is that George Eliot's theoretical bias has been too strong
for her, and in her eagerness to make him the bearer of an idea to the
central figure of the story she has sacrificed the realistic drawing
of Daniel, who is an impersonation at the cost of flesh and blood.
Given the fact that Daniel must in his personality represent some
unselfish idea, the question was: What actual idea, great in extent
and enough to fill a man's mind and soul, should be chosen? The
difficulty here arose, that if George Eliot had chosen some purely
imaginary topic it would have lacked reality, and would have moved
neither Gwendolen nor the reader into sympathy. If on the other hand
she had taken some stirring question of the day, the question as such
would have engrossed the interest and attention of the reader, and
would no longer have been subordinated to the chief artistic purpose
it has in the story. As it is, to many, the Jewish question as treated
and suggested in the novel has itself engrossed the attention of
readers, and has diverted their minds from the main artistic gist of
the story. But to the ordinary English reader the subject of Jewish
social life and aspirations was sufficiently remote. Nay, so narrow
are the sympathies and the intellectual horizon of many cultivated
Englishmen, that though they can be interested in the lives of gipsies
and farm laborers, they cannot "screw up an interest in those Jews."</p>

<p>To Daniel however it was a real, stirring, and great idea to which he
wished to devote his life. Now, in order that Gwendolen should
<i>realize</i> in herself such a great impersonal idea, she had to fall in
love with the man whose life they filled, and through her heart and
her love for him it would reach her mind and raise her thoughts.
Daniel, again, the man she loves, is contrasted with the narrow and
selfish man, the hardened and crystallized type of another social
world, consuming itself in its own self-love.</p>

<p>All Gwendolen's experiences directly or indirectly tend to bring about
this development of her soul. A striking scene in this sense is her
interview with Klesmer, the genuine and thorough musician devoted to
his art and work. And when she comes out of the final soul's tragedy
we feel that the woman has stood the test of fire, and has realized
the greatness and overwhelming vastness of the spiritual world. G. H.
Lewes, to whom the writer communicated this conception of 'Daniel
Deronda' assured him that he had grasped the central idea which George
Eliot had in her mind, and the actual history in the story's
construction.</p>

<p>Gwendolen's counterpart (and there are many in George Eliot's books)
is Dorothea in 'Middlemarch.' She starts with great and extraordinary
ideas, and must, through life and suffering, realize the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5374" id="Page_5374">[Pg 5374]</a></span>moral
justification of the simple and commonplace in life. The contrasting
types illustrating this central point can be found in every work:
Dorothea and Rosamond on the one side,&mdash;original, spiritual, striving
as commonplace selfishness,&mdash;and Dorothea and Ladislaw as heavy,
serious, intellectual morality, and light, playful, artistic freedom,
on the other; Lydgate with his great reformatory ideas, slowly
enfeebled and annihilated in his Samson-like vigor by the pretty,
selfish, shallow-souled Rosamond of provincial worldliness. Gwendolen
is also contrasted with Mirah. In 'Adam Bede,' again, Dinah and Hetty
present the same contrasts as do Tito Melema and Romola, Esther and
Felix Holt. Maggie Tulliver and her brother Tom, the spirit of revolt
in Maggie and the hard conventionality of respectability in her
brother Tom, are strongly marked types of this kind. Maggie's conflict
with her narrow and commonplace surroundings and their conventional
respectability are typified in the Mill. It is a wonderful touch of
artistic suggestion that she and her brother are finally submerged in
the Mill, carried away by the flood. This novel reflects more
thoroughly the spirit of Greek tragedy than any other work of modern
fiction. The Mill, and the part it plays in the life of the Tulliver
family and in Maggie's sorrows, are like great Fate in the Greek
tragedy. It is an embodiment of the hard and unrelenting tyranny of
the powers that are. Even in 'Silas Marner,' the most artistic and
least doctrinaire of her novels, the moral process of remedying
Silas's social unfitness and misanthropy is the central idea. Space
will not allow us to give further illustrations of this idea in her
novels; but enough has been said to enable the reader to test it and
follow it up for himself.</p>

<p>The two most striking qualities in George Eliot as a writer are her
humor and her sympathy. They are realty connected with one another.
The power of intellectual observation, when coupled with the power of
feeling sympathy, produces humor; the purely intellectual or objective
cast of mind produces wit; while the purely subjective habit of mind
is unable to produce either.</p>

<p>But with all her wide range of sympathy, upon which we have been
dwelling, its limitations can still be discerned. The careful observer
will recognize that the subjective attitude of the woman cannot wholly
be hidden from view. The chief women into whom she projects herself
are after all those that are nearest to herself, and she cannot help
treating them as favorites and bestowing the greater attention upon
them: Daniel only exists as a creation to develop Gwendolen; nay,
Savonarola is really constructed for Romola's spiritual development,
Casaubon for Dorothea, and so on. A still more marked and important
limitation in her sympathies, arising out of her ethical bias, is her
pronounced dislike to all morbid art, all that is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5375" id="Page_5375">[Pg 5375]</a></span>fantastic. The
poetry of Byron, the music of Chopin, all forms of morbid sentiment,
are so repulsive to her nature that she cannot treat them with
tolerance or even with humor. Remarks on Esther in 'Felix Holt' bear
this out. Probably this is an autobiographical touch, and having freed
herself from these morbid tendencies in her youth, she could never
look back upon them with tolerance.</p>

<p>Her seriousness and ethical bias may at times also have impaired her
style. Her extensive studies in science and philosophy often make her
ponderous in thought and in expression. The fondness with which she
takes her similes from science is often confusing to the reader who is
unfamiliar with the facts and thoughts that are used as illustrations.
She never quite overcame the temptation to insert what was new and
striking to herself; so that her science and philosophy never reached
that mature stage of mental assimilation in which they manifest
themselves merely in the general fullness of thought, without ever
asserting themselves as science or as philosophy. Still, no writer of
fiction has ever introduced reflections and episodes <i>in propria
persona</i> which are so striking and well worth reading in themselves.
When her imitators attempt this they fail signally, and one need but
compare such passages with those of George Eliot to realize her
greatness as a writer and as a thinker.</p>

<p>To sum up the estimate of George Eliot as a novelist, we would say
that she is the greatest representative of the analytical and
psychological school, fixing with truth and sensuousness the types of
English provincial life; with a final purpose, which she achieved, of
illustrating by them the ideals of social ethics for the wider life of
humanity.</p>

<h3><a name="RESCUE" id="RESCUE"></a>THE FINAL RESCUE</h3>

<h4>From 'The Mill on the Floss'</h4>

<p>At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden
cold about her knees and feet; it was water flowing under
her. She started up; the stream was flowing under the
door that led into the passage. She was not bewildered for an
instant; she knew it was the flood!</p>

<p>The tumult of emotion she had been enduring for the last
twelve hours seemed to have left a great calm in her; without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5376" id="Page_5376">[Pg 5376]</a></span>
screaming, she hurried with the candle up-stairs to Bob Jakin's
bedroom. The door was ajar; she went in and shook him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Bob, the flood is come! it is in the house! let us see if we
can make the boats safe."</p>

<p>She lighted his candle, while the poor wife, snatching up her
baby, burst into screams; and then she hurried down again to
see if the waters were rising fast. There was a step down into
the room at the door leading from the staircase; she saw that
the water was already on a level with the step. While she was
looking, something came with a tremendous crash against the
window and sent the leaded panes and the old wooden framework
inwards in shivers, the water pouring in after it.</p>

<p>"It is the boat!" cried Maggie. "Bob, come down to get the
boats!"</p>

<p>And without a moment's shudder of fear she plunged through
the water, which was rising fast to her knees, and by the glimmering
light of the candle she had left on the stairs she mounted
on to the window-sill and crept into the boat, which was left
with the prow lodging and protruding through the window. Bob
was not long after her, hurrying without shoes or stockings, but
with the lantern in his hand.</p>

<p>"Why, they're both here,&mdash;both the boats," said Bob, as he
got into the one where Maggie was. "It's wonderful this fastening
isn't broke too, as well as the mooring."</p>

<p>In the excitement of getting into the other boat, unfastening
it, and mastering an oar, Bob was not struck with the danger
Maggie incurred. We are not apt to fear for the fearless when
we are companions in their danger, and Bob's mind was absorbed
in possible expedients for the safety of the helpless in-doors.
The fact that Maggie had been up, had waked him, and had
taken the lead in activity, gave Bob a vague impression of her
as one who would help to protect, not need to be protected.
She too had got possession of an oar and had pushed off, so as
to release the boat from the overhanging window frame.</p>

<p>"The water's rising so fast," said Bob, "I doubt it'll be in
at the chambers before long,&mdash;th' house is so low. I've more
mind to get Prissy and the child and the mother into the boat,
if I could, and trusten to the water,&mdash;for th' old house is none
so safe. And if I let go the boat&mdash;but <i>you</i>!" he exclaimed,
suddenly lifting the light of his lantern on Maggie, as she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5377" id="Page_5377">[Pg 5377]</a></span>
stood in the rain with the oar in her hand and her black hair
streaming.</p>

<p>Maggie had no time to answer, for a new tidal current swept
along the line of the houses, and drove both the boats out on to
the wide water with a force that carried them far past the
meeting current of the river.</p>

<p>In the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing,
but that she had suddenly passed away from that life which she
had been dreading; it was the transition of death without its
agony,&mdash;and she was alone in the darkness with God.</p>

<p>The whole thing had been so rapid, so dream-like, that the
threads of ordinary association were broken; she sank down on
the seat clutching the oar mechanically, and for a long while had
no distinct conception of her position. The first thing that
waked her to fuller consciousness was the cessation of the rain,
and a perception that the darkness was divided by the faintest
light, which parted the overhanging gloom from the immeasurable
watery level below. She was driven out upon the flood,&mdash;that
awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of,
which had made the nightmare of her childish dreams. And
with that thought there rushed in the vision of the old home,
and Tom, and her mother,&mdash;they had all listened together.</p>

<p>"O God, where am I? Which is the way home?" she cried
out, in the dim loneliness.</p>

<p>What was happening to them at the Mill? The flood had
once nearly destroyed it. They might be in danger, in distress,&mdash;her
mother and her brother, alone there, beyond reach of
help! Her whole soul was strained now on that thought; and
she saw the long-loved faces looking for help into the darkness,
and finding none.</p>

<p>She was floating in smooth water now,&mdash;perhaps far on the
over-flooded fields. There was no sense of present danger to
check the outgoing of her mind to the old home; and she strained
her eyes against the curtain of gloom that she might seize the
first sight of her whereabouts,&mdash;that she might catch some faint
suggestion of the spot towards which all her anxieties tended.</p>

<p>Oh, how welcome the widening of that dismal watery level,
the gradual uplifting of the cloudy firmament, the slowly defining
blackness of objects above the glassy dark! Yes, she must
be out on the fields; those were the tops of hedgerow trees.
Which way did the river lie? Looking behind her, she saw the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5378" id="Page_5378">[Pg 5378]</a></span>
lines of black trees; looking before her, there were none; then
the river lay before her. She seized an oar and began to paddle
the boat forward with the energy of wakening hope; the dawning
seemed to advance more swiftly, now she was in action; and she
could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a
mound where they had taken refuge. Onward she paddled and
rowed by turns in the growing twilight; her wet clothes clung
round her, and her streaming hair was dashed about by the
wind, but she was hardly conscious of any bodily sensations,&mdash;except
a sensation of strength, inspired by mighty emotion.
Along with the sense of danger and possible rescue for those
long-remembered beings at the old home, there was an undefined
sense of reconcilement with her brother: what quarrel, what
harshness, what unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence
of a great calamity, when all the artificial vesture of our life
is gone, and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal
needs? Vaguely Maggie felt this, in the strong resurgent love
towards her brother that swept away all the later impressions of
hard, cruel offense and misunderstanding, and left only the deep,
underlying, unshakable memories of early union.</p>

<p>But now there was a large dark mass in the distance, and
near to her Maggie could discern the current of the river. The
dark mass must be&mdash;yes, it was&mdash;St. Ogg's. Ah, now she
knew which way to look for the first glimpse of the well-known
trees&mdash;the gray willows, the now yellowing chestnuts&mdash;and above
them the old roof! But there was no color, no shape yet; all
was faint and dim. More and more strongly the energies seemed
to come and put themselves forth, as if her life were a stored-up
force that was being spent in this hour, unneeded for any
future.</p>

<p>She must get her boat into the current of the Floss, else she
would never be able to pass the Ripple and approach the house:
this was the thought that occurred to her, as she imagined with
more and more vividness the state of things round the old home.
But then she might be carried very far down, and be unable to
guide her boat out of the current again. For the first time distinct
ideas of danger began to press upon her; but there was no
choice of courses, no room for hesitation, and she floated into the
current. Swiftly she went now, without effort; more and more
clearly in the lessening distance and the growing light she began
to discern the objects that she knew must be the well-known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5379" id="Page_5379">[Pg 5379]</a></span>
trees and roofs; nay, she was not far off a rushing muddy current
that must be the strangely altered Ripple.</p>

<p>Great God! there were floating masses in it, that might dash
against her boat as she passed, and cause her to perish too soon.
What were those masses?</p>

<p>For the first time Maggie's heart began to beat in an agony
of dread. She sat helpless, dimly conscious that she was being
floated along, more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash.
But the horror was transient; it passed away before the oncoming
warehouses of St. Ogg's. She had passed the mouth of the
Ripple, then; <i>now</i>, she must use all her skill and power to manage
the boat and get it if possible out of the current. She could
see now that the bridge was broken down; she could see the
masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field. But no
boats were to be seen moving on the river,&mdash;such as had been
laid hands on were employed in the flooded streets.</p>

<p>With new resolution Maggie seized her oar, and stood up
again to paddle; but the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness
of the river, and she was carried along beyond the bridge. She
could hear shouts from the windows overlooking the river, as if
the people there were calling to her. It was not till she had
passed on nearly to Tofton that she could get the boat clear of
the current. Then with one yearning look towards her uncle
Deane's house that lay farther down the river, she took to both
her oars and rowed with all her might across the watery fields,
back towards the Mill. Color was beginning to awake now, and
as she approached the Dorlcote fields, she could discern the tints
of the trees, could see the old Scotch firs far to the right; and
the home chestnuts,&mdash;oh, how deep they lay in the water,&mdash;deeper
than the trees on this side the hill! And the roof of the Mill&mdash;where
was it? Those heavy fragments hurrying down the Ripple,&mdash;what
had they meant? But it was not the house,&mdash;the
house stood firm; drowned up to the first story, but still firm;&mdash;or
was it broken in at the end towards the Mill?</p>

<p>With panting joy that she was there at last,&mdash;joy that overcame
all distress,&mdash;Maggie neared the front of the house. At
first she heard no sound; she saw no object moving. Her boat
was on a level with the up-stairs window. She called out in a
loud piercing voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is
Maggie!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5380" id="Page_5380">[Pg 5380]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she
heard Tom's voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is it? Have you brought a boat?"</p>

<p>"It is I, Tom,&mdash;Maggie. Where is mother?"</p>

<p>"She is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday.
I'll come down to the lower window."</p>

<p>"Alone, Maggie?" said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment,
as he opened the middle window, on a level with the boat.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you.
Get in quickly. Is there no one else?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, stepping into the boat, "I fear the man is
drowned; he was carried down the Ripple, I think, when part
of the Mill fell with the crash of trees and stones against it;
I've shouted again and again, and there has been no answer.
Give me the oars, Maggie."</p>

<p>It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the
wide water,&mdash;he face to face with Maggie,&mdash;that the full meaning
of what had happened rushed upon his mind. It came with
so overpowering a force,&mdash;it was such a new revelation to his
spirit of the depths in life that had lain beyond his vision, which
he had fancied so keen and clear,&mdash;that he was unable to ask a
question. They sat mutely gazing at each other,&mdash;Maggie with
eyes of intense life looking out from a weary, beaten face; Tom
pale, with a certain awe and humiliation. Thought was busy
though the lips were silent; and though he could ask no question,
he guessed a story of almost miraculous, Divinely protected
effort. But at last a mist gathered over the blue-gray eyes, and
the lips found a word they could utter,&mdash;the old childish "Magsie!"</p>

<p>Maggie could make no answer but a long, deep sob of that
mysterious, wondrous happiness that is one with pain.</p>

<p>As soon as she could speak, she said:&mdash;"We will go to Lucy,
Tom; we'll go and see if she is safe, and then we can help the
rest."</p>

<p>Tom rowed with untired vigor, and with a different speed
from poor Maggie's. The boat was soon in the current of the
river again, and soon they would be at Tofton.</p>

<p>"Park House stands high up out of the flood," said Maggie.
"Perhaps they have got Lucy there."</p>

<p>Nothing else was said; a new danger was being carried towards
them by the river. Some wooden machinery had just given way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5381" id="Page_5381">[Pg 5381]</a></span>
on one of the wharves, and huge fragments were being floated
along. The sun was rising now, and the wide area of watery
desolation was spread out in dreadful clearness around them;
in dreadful clearness floated onward the hurrying, threatening
masses. A large company in a boat that was working its way
along under the Tofton houses observed their danger, and shouted,
"Get out of the current!"</p>

<p>But that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before
him, saw death rushing on them. Huge fragments, clinging
together in fatal fellowship, made one wide mass across the
stream.</p>

<p>"It is coming, Maggie!" Tom said, in a deep, hoarse voice,
loosing the oars and clasping her.</p>

<p>The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water,
and the huge mass was hurrying on in hideous triumph.</p>

<p>But soon the keel of the boat reappeared, a black speck on
the golden water.</p>

<p>The boat reappeared, but brother and sister had gone down
in an embrace never to be parted; living through again in one
supreme moment the days when they had clasped their little
hands in love, and roamed the daisied fields together.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Nature repairs her ravages,&mdash;repairs them with her sunshine,
and with human labor. The desolation wrought by that flood
had left little visible trace on the face of the earth, five years
after. The fifth autumn was rich in golden cornstacks, rising in
thick clusters among the distant hedgerows; the wharves and
warehouses on the Floss were busy again, with echoes of eager
voices, with hopeful lading and unlading.</p>

<p>And every man and woman mentioned in this history was
still living, except those whose end we know.</p>

<p>Nature repairs her ravages, but not all. The uptorn trees
are not rooted again; the parted hills are left scarred; if there is
a new growth, the trees are not the same as the old, and the
hills underneath their green vesture bear the marks of the past
rending. To the eyes that have dwelt on the past, there is no
thorough repair.</p>

<p>Dorlcote Mill was rebuilt. And Dorlcote church-yard&mdash;where
the brick grave that held a father whom we know, was found
with the stone laid prostrate upon it after the flood&mdash;had recovered
all its grassy order and decent quiet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5382" id="Page_5382">[Pg 5382]</a></span></p>

<p>Near that brick grave there was a tomb erected, very soon
after the flood, for two bodies that were found in close embrace;
and it was visited at different moments by two men who both
felt that their keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever
buried there.</p>

<p>One of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside
him; but that was years after.</p>

<p>The other was always solitary. His great companionship was
among the trees of the Red Deeps, where the buried joy seemed
still to hover, like a revisiting spirit.</p>

<p>The tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, and
below the names it was written:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="WORTHIES" id="WORTHIES"></a>THE VILLAGE WORTHIES</h3>

<h4>From 'Silas Marner'</h4>

<p>The conversation, which was at a high pitch of animation when
Silas approached the door of the Rainbow, had as usual
been slow and intermittent when the company first assembled.
The pipes began to be puffed in a silence which had an
air of severity; the more important customers, who drank spirits
and sat nearest the fire, staring at each other as if a bet were
depending on the first man who winked; while the beer-drinkers,
chiefly men in fustian jackets and smock-frocks, kept their eyelids
down and rubbed their hands across their mouths, as if their
draughts of beer were a funeral duty attended with embarrassing
sadness. At last Mr. Snell, the landlord, a man of a neutral
disposition, accustomed to stand aloof from human differences
as those of beings who were all alike in need of liquor, broke
silence by saying in a doubtful tone to his cousin the butcher:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some folks 'ud say that was a fine beast you druv in yesterday,
Bob?"</p>

<p>The butcher, a jolly, smiling, red-haired man, was not disposed
to answer rashly. He gave a few puffs before he spat,
and replied, "And they wouldn't be fur wrong, John."</p>

<p>After this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely
as before.</p>

<p>"Was it a red Durham?" said the farrier, taking up the
thread of discourse after the lapse of a few minutes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5383" id="Page_5383">[Pg 5383]</a></span></p>

<p>The farrier looked at the landlord, and the landlord looked at
the butcher, as the person who must take the responsibility of
answering.</p>

<p>"Red it was," said the butcher, in his good-humored husky
treble,&mdash;"and a Durham it was."</p>

<p>"Then you needn't tell <i>me</i> who you bought it of," said the
farrier, looking round with some triumph: "I know who it is has
got the red Durhams o' this country-side. And she'd a white
star on her brow, I'll bet a penny?" The farrier leaned forward
with his hands on his knees as he put this question, and his eyes
twinkled knowingly.</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;she might," said the butcher, slowly, considering
that he was giving a decided affirmative. "I don't say
contrairy."</p>

<p>"I knew that very well," said the farrier, throwing himself
backward again, and speaking defiantly; "if <i>I</i> don't know Mr.
Lammeter's cows, I should like to know who does&mdash;that's all.
And as for the cow you've bought, bargain or no bargain, I've
been at the drenching of her&mdash;contradick me who will."</p>

<p>The farrier looked fierce, and the mild butcher's conversational
spirit was roused a little.</p>

<p>"I'm not for contradicking no man," he said; "I'm for peace
and quietness. Some are for cutting long ribs&mdash;I'm for cutting
'em short myself; but <i>I</i> don't quarrel with 'em. All I say is, it's
a lovely carkiss&mdash;and anybody as was reasonable, it 'ud bring
tears into their eyes to look at it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's the cow as I drenched, whatever it is," pursued the
farrier, angrily; "and it was Mr. Lammeter's cow, else you told
a lie when you said it was a red Durham."</p>

<p>"I tell no lies," said the butcher, with the same mild huskiness
as before; "and I contradick none&mdash;not if a man was to
swear himself black; he's no meat o' mine, nor none o' my bargains.
All I say is, it's a lovely carkiss. And what I say I'll
stick to; but I'll quarrel wi' no man."</p>

<p>"No," said the farrier with bitter sarcasm, looking at the
company generally; "and p'raps you aren't pig-headed; and p'raps
you didn't say the cow was a red Durham; and p'raps you didn't
say she'd got a star on her brow&mdash;stick to that, now you're
at it."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the landlord, "let the cow alone. The
truth lies atween you; you're both right and both wrong, as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5384" id="Page_5384">[Pg 5384]</a></span>
allays say. And as for the cow's being Mr. Lammeter's, I say
nothing to that; but this I say, as the Rainbow's the Rainbow.
And for the matter o' that, if the talk is to be o' the Lammeters,
<i>you</i> know the most upo' that head, eh, Mr. Macey? You remember
when first Mr. Lammeter's father come into these parts, and
took the Warrens?"</p>

<p>Mr. Macey, tailor and parish clerk, the latter of which functions
rheumatism had of late obliged him to share with a small-featured
young man who sat opposite him, held his white head
on one side, and twirled his thumbs with an air of complacency,
slightly seasoned with criticism. He smiled pityingly in answer
to the landlord's appeal, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; I know, I know; but I let other folks talk. I've laid
by now, and gev up to the young uns. Ask them as have been
to school at Tarley; they've learned pernouncing; that's come up
since my day."</p>

<p>"If you're pointing at me, Mr. Macey," said the deputy clerk,
with an air of anxious propriety, "I'm nowise a man to speak out
of my place. As the psalm says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I know what's right; nor only so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But also practice what I know.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Well, then, I wish you'd keep hold o' the tune when it's set
for you; if you're for practicing I wish you'd prac<i>tice</i> that," said a
large jocose-looking man, an excellent wheelwright in his weekday
capacity, but on Sundays leader of the choir. He winked, as
he spoke, at two of the company who were known officially as
"the bassoon" and "the key bugle," in the confidence that he was
expressing the sense of the musical profession in Raveloe.</p>

<p>Mr. Tookey the deputy clerk, who shared the unpopularity
common to deputies, turned very red, but replied with careful
moderation:&mdash;"Mr. Winthrop, if you'll bring me any proof as I'm
in the wrong, I'm not the man to say I won't alter. But there's
people set up their own ears for a standard, and expect the
whole choir to follow 'em. There may be two opinions, I hope."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Mr. Macey, who felt very well satisfied with
this attack on youthful presumption; "you're right there, Tookey:
there's allays two 'pinions; there's the 'pinion a man has of himsen,
and there's the 'pinion other folks have on him. There'd
be two 'pinions about a cracked bell, if the bell could hear
itself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5385" id="Page_5385">[Pg 5385]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Macey," said poor Tookey, serious amidst the
general laughter, "I undertook to partially fill up the office of
parish clerk by Mr. Crackenthorp's desire, whenever your infirmities
should make you unfitting; and it's one of the rights
thereof to sing in the choir&mdash;else why have you done the same
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Ah! but the old gentleman and you are two folks," said
Ben Winthrop. "The old gentleman's got a gift. Why, the
Squire used to invite him to take a glass, only to hear him sing
the 'Red Rovier'; didn't he, Mr. Macey? It's a nat'ral gift.
There's my little lad Aaron, he's got a gift&mdash;he can sing a tune
off straight, like a throstle. But as for you, Master Tookey,
you'd better stick to your 'Amens': your voice is well enough
when you keep it up in your nose. It's your inside as isn't
right made for music: it's no better nor a hollow stalk."</p>

<p>This kind of unflinching frankness was the most piquant
form of joke to the company at the Rainbow, and Ben Winthrop's
insult was felt by everybody to have capped Mr. Macey's
epigram.</p>

<p>"I see what it is plain enough," said Mr. Tookey, unable to
keep cool any longer. "There's a consperacy to turn me out o'
the choir, as I shouldn't share the Christmas money&mdash;that's
where it is. But I shall speak to Mr. Crackenthorp; I'll not be
put upon by no man."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Tookey," said Ben Winthrop. "We'll pay you
your share to keep out of it&mdash;that's what we'll do. There's
things folks 'ud pay to be rid on, besides varmin."</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the landlord, who felt that paying people
for their absence was a principle dangerous to society; "a joke's
a joke. We're all good friends here, I hope. We must give and
take. You're both right and you're both wrong, as I say. I
agree wi' Mr. Macey here, as there's two opinions; and if mine
was asked, I should say they're both right. Tookey's right and
Winthrop's right, and they've only got to split the difference
and make themselves even."</p>

<p>The farrier was puffing his pipe rather fiercely, in some contempt
at this trivial discussion. He had no ear for music himself,
and never went to church, as being of the medical profession, and
likely to be in requisition for delicate cows. But the butcher,
having music in his soul, had listened with a divided desire, for
Tookey's defeat and for the preservation of the peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5386" id="Page_5386">[Pg 5386]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be sure," he said, following up the landlord's conciliatory
view, "we're fond of our old clerk; it's nat'ral, and him used
to be such a singer, and got a brother as is known for the first
fiddler in this country-side. Eh, it's a pity but what Solomon
lived in our village, and could give us a tune when he liked, eh,
Mr. Macey? I'd keep him in liver and lights for nothing&mdash;that
I would."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," said Mr. Macey, in the height of complacency;
"our family's been known for musicianers as far back as anybody
can tell. But them things are dying out, as I tell Solomon
every time he comes round; there's no voices like what there
used to be, and there's nobody remembers what we remember, if
it ain't the old crows."</p>

<p>"Ay, you remember when first Mr. Lammeter's father came
into these parts, don't you, Mr. Macey?" said the landlord.</p>

<p>"I should think I did," said the old man, who had now gone
through that complimentary process necessary to bring him up
to the point of narration; "and a fine old gentleman he was&mdash;as
fine and finer nor the Mr. Lammeter as now is. He came from
a bit north'ard, so far as I could ever make out. But there's
nobody rightly knows about those parts; only it couldn't be far
north'ard, nor much different from this country, for he brought a
fine breed o' sheep with him, so there must be pastures there, and
everything reasonable. We heard tell as he'd sold his own land
to come and take the Warrens, and that seemed odd for a man as
had land of his own, to come and rent a farm in a strange place.
But they said it was along of his wife's dying; though there's
reasons in things as nobody knows on&mdash;that's pretty much what
I've made out; though some folks are so wise that they'll find
you fifty reasons straight off, and all the while the real reason's
winking at 'em in the corner, and they niver see't. Howsomever,
it was soon seen as we'd got a new parish'ner as know'd
the rights and customs o' things, and kep a good house, and was
well looked on by everybody. And the young man&mdash;that's the
Mr. Lammeter as now is, for he'd niver a sister&mdash;soon begun to
court Miss Osgood, that's the sister o' the Mr. Osgood as now is,
and a fine handsome lass she was&mdash;eh, you can't think&mdash;they
pretend this young lass is like her, but that's the way wi' people
as don't know what come before 'em. <i>I</i> should know, for I helped
the old rector, Mr. Drumlow as was, I helped him marry
'em."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5387" id="Page_5387">[Pg 5387]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Mr. Macey paused; he always gave his narrative in installments,
expecting to be questioned according to precedent.</p>

<p>"Ay, and a partic'lar thing happened, didn't it, Mr. Macey,
so as you were likely to remember that marriage?" said the
landlord, in a congratulatory tone.</p>

<p>"I should think there did&mdash;a <i>very</i> partic'lar thing," said Mr.
Macey, nodding sideways. "For Mr. Drumlow&mdash;poor old gentleman,
I was fond on him, though he'd got a bit confused in
his head, what wi' age and wi' taking a drop o' summat warm
when the service come of a cold morning; and young Mr.
Lammeter he'd have no way but he must be married in Janiwary,
which, to be sure, 's a unreasonable time to be married in,
for it isn't like a christening or a burying, as you can't help;
and so Mr. Drumlow&mdash;poor old gentleman, I was fond on him;
but when he come to put the questions, he put 'em by the rule
o' contrairy like, and he says, 'Wilt thou have this man to thy
wedded wife?' says he, and then he says, 'Wilt thou have this
woman to thy wedded husband?' says he. But the partic'larest
thing of all is, as nobody took any notice on it but me, and
they answered straight off 'Yes,' like as if it had been me saying
'Amen' i' the right place, without listening to what went before."</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> knew what was going on well enough, didn't you,
Mr. Macey? You were live enough, eh?" said the butcher.</p>

<p>"Lor bless you!" said Mr. Macey, pausing, and smiling in
pity at the impotence of his hearers' imagination,&mdash;"why, I was
all of a tremble: it was as if I'd been a coat pulled by the two
tails, like; for I couldn't stop the parson, I couldn't take upon
me to do that; and yet I said to myself, I says, 'Suppose they
shouldn't be fast married, 'cause the words are contrairy?' and
my head went working like a mill, for I was allays uncommon
for turning things over and seeing all round 'em; and I says to
myself, 'Is't the meanin' or the words as makes folks fast i'
wedlock?' For the parson meant right, and the bride and bridegroom
meant right. But then when I come to think on it,
meanin' goes but a little way i' most things, for you may mean
to stick things together and your glue may be bad, and then
where are you? And so I says to mysen, 'It isn't the meanin',
it's the glue.' And I was worreted as if I'd got three bells to
pull at once, when we got into the vestry, and they begun to
sign their names. But where's the use o' talking?&mdash;you can't
think what goes on in a 'cute man's inside."</p>

<p>"But you held in for all that, didn't you, Mr. Macey?" said
the landlord.</p>

<p>"Ay, I held in tight till I was by mysen, wi' Mr. Drumlow,
and then I out wi' everything, but respectful, as I allays did.
And he made light on it, and he says:&mdash;'Pooh, pooh, Macey,
make yourself easy,' he says, 'it's neither the meaning nor the
words&mdash;it's the register does it&mdash;that's the glue.' So you see
he settled it easy; for parsons and doctors know everything by
heart, like, so as they aren't worreted wi' thinking what's the
rights and wrongs o' things, as I'n been many and many's the
time. And sure enough the wedding turned out all right, on'y
poor Mrs. Lammeter&mdash;that's Miss Osgood as was&mdash;died afore
the lasses were growed up; but for prosperity and everything
respectable, there's no family more looked on."</p>

<p>Every one of Mr. Macey's audience had heard this story many
times, but it was listened to as if it had been a favorite tune,
and at certain points the puffing of the pipes was momentarily
suspended, that the listeners might give their whole minds to
the expected words. But there was more to come; and Mr.
Snell, the landlord, duly put the leading question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, old Mr. Lammeter had a pretty fortin, didn't they
say, when he come into these parts?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes," said Mr. Macey; "but I dare say it's as much as
this Mr. Lammeter's done to keep it whole.... Why, they're
stables four times as big as Squire Cass's, for he thought o'
nothing but hosses and hunting, Cliff didn't&mdash;a Lunnon tailor,
some folks said, as had gone mad wi' cheating. For he couldn't
ride, Lor bless you! they said he'd got no more grip o' the hoss
than if his legs had been cross-sticks: my grandfather heared old
Squire Cass say so many and many a time. But ride he would,
as if Old Harry had been a-driving him; and he'd a son, a lad o'
sixteen; and nothing would his father have him do but he must
ride and ride&mdash;though the lad was frightened, they said. And it
was a common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out
o' the lad, and make a gentleman on him&mdash;not but what I'm a
tailor myself, but in respect as God made me such, I'm proud on
it, for 'Macey, tailor,' 's been wrote up over our door since afore
the Queen's heads went out on the shillings. But Cliff, he was
ashamed o' being called a tailor, and he was sore vexed as his
riding was laughed at, and nobody o' the gentlefolks here about
could abide him. Howsomever, the poor lad got sickly and died,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5389" id="Page_5389">[Pg 5389]</a></span>
and the father didn't live long after him, for he got queerer nor
ever, and they said he used to go out i' the dead o' the night,
wi' a lantern in his hand, to the stables, and set a lot o' lights
burning, for he got as he couldn't sleep; and there he'd stand,
cracking his whip and looking at his hosses; and they said it was
a mercy as the stables didn't get burnt down wi' the poor dumb
creaturs in 'em. But at last he died raving, and they found as
he'd left all his property, Warrens and all, to a Lunnon Charity,
and that's how the Warrens come to be Charity Land; though
as for the stables, Mr. Lammeter never uses 'em&mdash;they're out o'
all charicter&mdash;Lor bless you! if you was to set the doors a-banging
in 'em, it 'ud sound like thunder half o'er the parish."</p>

<p>"Ay, but there's more going on in the stables than what folks
see by daylight, eh, Mr. Macey?" said the landlord.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay; go that way of a dark night, that's all," said Mr.
Macey, winking mysteriously, "and then make believe, if you
like, as you didn't see lights i' the stables, nor hear the stamping
o' the hosses, nor the cracking o' the whips, and howling too, if
it's tow'rt daybreak. 'Cliff's Holiday' has been the name of it
ever sin' I were a boy; that's to say, some said as it was the
holiday Old Harry gev him from roasting, like. That's what my
father told me, and he was a reasonable man, though there's
folks nowadays know what happened afore they were born better
nor they know their own business."</p>

<p>"What do you say to that, eh, Dowlas?" said the landlord,
turning to the farrier, who was swelling with impatience for his
cue: "here's a nut for <i>you</i> to crack."</p>

<p>Mr. Dowlas was the negative spirit in the company, and was
proud of his position.</p>

<p>"Say? I say what a man <i>should</i> say as doesn't shut his
eyes to look at a finger-post. I say as I'm ready to wager any
man ten pound, if he'll stand out wi' me any dry night in the
pasture before the Warren stables, as we shall neither see lights
nor hear noises, if it isn't the blowing of our own noses. That's
what I say, and I've said it many a time; but there's nobody
'ull ventur a ten-pun' note on their ghos'es as they make so
sure of."</p>

<p>"Why, Dowlas, that's easy betting, that is," said Ben Winthrop.
"You might as well bet a man as he wouldn't catch the
rheumatise if he stood up to 's neck in the pool of a frosty
night. It 'ud be fine fun for a man to win his bet as he'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5390" id="Page_5390">[Pg 5390]</a></span>
catch the rheumatise. Folks as believe in Cliff's Holiday aren't
a-going to ventur near it for a matter o' ten pound."</p>

<p>"If Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it," said Mr.
Macey, with a sarcastic smile, tapping his thumbs together, "he's
no call to lay any bet; let him go and stan' by himself&mdash;there's
nobody 'ull hinder him; and then he can let the parish'ners
know if they're wrong."</p>

<p>"Thank you! I'm obliged to you," said the farrier, with a
snort of scorn. "If folks are fools, it's no business o' mine. <i>I</i>
don't want to make out the truth about ghos'es; I know it
a'ready. But I'm not against a bet&mdash;everything fair and open.
Let any man bet me ten pound as I shall see Cliff's Holiday,
and I'll go and stand by myself. I want no company. I'd as
lief do it as I'd fill this pipe."</p>

<p>"Ah, but who's to watch you, Dowlas, and see you do it?
That's no fair bet," said the butcher.</p>

<p>"No fair bet?" replied Mr. Dowlas angrily. "I should like
to hear any man stand up and say I want to bet unfair. Come
now, Master Lundy, I should like to hear you say it."</p>

<p>"Very like you would," said the butcher. "But it's no
business o' mine. You're none o' my bargains, and I aren't
a-going to try and 'bate your price. If anybody'll bid for you
at your own vallying, let him. I'm for peace and quietness, I
am."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what every yapping cur is, when you hold a
stick up at him," said the farrier. "But I'm afraid o' neither
man nor ghost, and I'm ready to lay a fair bet&mdash;I aren't a turntail
cur."</p>

<p>"Ay, but there's this in it, Dowlas," said the landlord, speaking
in a tone of much candor and tolerance. "There's folks, i'
my opinion, they can't see ghos'es, not if they stood as plain as
a pike-staff before 'em. And there's reason i' that. For there's
my wife, now, can't smell, not if she'd the strongest o' cheese
under her nose. I never seed a ghost myself; but then I says
to myself, 'Very like I haven't got the smell for 'em.' I mean,
putting a ghost for a smell, or else contrariways. And so I'm
for holding with both sides; for as I say, the truth lies between
'em. And if Dowlas was to go and stand, and say he'd never
seen a wink o' Cliff's Holiday all the night through, I'd back
him; and if anybody said as Cliff's Holiday was certain sure for
all that, I'd back <i>him</i> too. For the smell's what I go by."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5391" id="Page_5391">[Pg 5391]</a></span></p>

<p>The landlord's analogical argument was not well received by
the farrier&mdash;a man intensely opposed to compromise.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," he said setting down his glass with refreshed irritation;
"what's the smell got to do with it? Did ever a ghost
give a man a black eye? That's what I should like to know. If
ghos'es want me to believe in 'em, let 'em leave off skulking i'
the dark and i' lone places&mdash;let 'em come where there's company
and candles."</p>

<p>"As if ghos'es 'ud want to be believed in by anybody so
ignorant!" said Mr. Macey, in deep disgust at the farrier's crass
imcompetence to apprehend the conditions of ghostly phenomena.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="HALL_FARM" id="HALL_FARM"></a>THE HALL FARM</h3>

<h4>From 'Adam Bede'</h4>

<p>Evidently that gate is never opened; for the long grass and
the great hemlocks grow close against it; and if it were
opened, it is so rusty that the force necessary to turn to
on its hinges would be likely to pull down the square stone-built
pillars, to the detriment of the two stone lionesses which
grin with a doubtful carnivorous affability above a coat of arms
surmounting each of the pillars. It would be easy enough, by
the aid of the nicks in the stone pillars, to climb over the brick
wall with its smooth stone coping; but by putting our eyes close
to the rusty bars of the gate, we can see the house well enough,
and all but the very corners of the grassy inclosure.</p>

<p>It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale
powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity,
so as to bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship
with the limestone ornaments surrounding the three
gables, the windows, and the door-place. But the windows are
patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the
gate&mdash;it is never opened: how it would groan and grate against
the stone floor if it were! For it is a solid, heavy, handsome
door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a
sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey who had just seen his
master and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair.</p>

<p>But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage
of a chancery suit, and that the fruit from that grand double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5392" id="Page_5392">[Pg 5392]</a></span>
row of walnut-trees on the right hand of the inclosure would
fall and rot among the grass; if it were not that we heard the
booming bark of dogs echoing from great buildings at the back.
And now the half-weaned calves that have been sheltering themselves
in a gorse-built hovel against the left-hand wall come out
and set up a silly answer to that terrible bark, doubtless supposing
that it has reference to buckets of milk.</p>

<p>Yes, the house must be inhabited, and we will see by whom;
for imagination is a licensed trespasser: it has no fear of dogs,
but may climb over walls and peep in at windows with impunity.
Put your face to one of the glass panes in the right-hand window:
what do you see? A large open fireplace, with rusty dogs
in it, and a bare boarded floor; at the far end, fleeces of wool
stacked up; in the middle of the floor, some empty corn-bags.
That is the furniture of the dining-room. And what through the
left-hand window? Several clothes-horses, a pillion, a spinning-wheel,
and an old box wide open, and stuffed full of colored
rags. At the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll,
which so far as mutilation is concerned bears a strong resemblance
to the finest Greek sculpture, and especially in the total
loss of its nose. Near it there is a little chair, and the butt-end
of a boy's leather long-lashed whip.</p>

<p>The history of the house is plain now. It was once the residence
of a country squire, whose family, probably dwindling
down to mere spinsterhood, got merged in the more territorial
name of Donnithorne. It was once the Hall; it is now the Hall
Farm. Like the life in some coast town that was once a watering-place,
and is now a port, where the genteel streets are silent
and grass-grown, and the docks and warehouses busy and resonant,
the life at the Hall has changed its focus, and no longer
radiates from the parlor, but from the kitchen and the farm-yard.</p>

<p>Plenty of life there! though this is the drowsiest time of the
year, just before hay harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the
day too, for it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past
three by Mrs. Poyser's handsome eight-day clock. But there is
always a stronger sense of life when the sun is brilliant after
rain; and now he is pouring down his beams, and making
sparkles among the wet straw, and lighting up every patch of
vivid green moss on the red tiles of the cow-shed, and turning
even the muddy water that is hurrying along the channel to the
drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks, who are seizing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5393" id="Page_5393">[Pg 5393]</a></span>
the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as
possible. There is quite a concert of noises: the great bull-dog,
chained against the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation
by the unwary approach of a cock too near the mouth of his
kennel, and sends forth a thundering bark, which is answered by
two fox-hounds shut up in the opposite cow-house; the old top-knotted
hens, scratching with their chicks among the straw, set
up a sympathetic croaking as the discomfited cock joins them;
a sow with her brood, all very muddy as to the legs, and curled
as to the tail, throws in some deep staccato notes; our friends
the calves are bleating from the home croft; and under all, a
fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices.</p>

<p>For the great barn doors are thrown wide open, and men are
busy there mending the harness under the superintendence of
Mr. Goby the "whittaw," otherwise saddler, who entertains them
with the latest Treddleston gossip. It is certainly rather an
unfortunate day that Alick the shepherd has chosen for having
the whittaws, since the morning turned out so wet; and Mrs.
Poyser has spoken her mind pretty strongly as to the dirt which
the extra number of men's shoes brought into the house at dinner-time.
Indeed, she has not yet recovered her equanimity on
the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since dinner
and the house floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as everything
else in that wonderful house-place, where the only chance
of collecting a few grains of dust would be to climb on the salt-coffer,
and put your finger on the high mantel shelf on which
the glittering brass candlesticks are enjoying their summer sinecure;
for at this time of year of course every one goes to bed
while it is yet light, or at least light enough to discern the outline
of objects after you have bruised your shins against them.
Surely nowhere else could an oak clock-case and an oak table
have got to such a polish by the hand: genuine "elbow polish,"
as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she thanked God she never had any
of your varnished rubbish in her house. Hetty Sorrel often took
the opportunity, when her aunt's back was turned, of looking
at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces, for
the oak table was usually turned up like a screen, and was more
for ornament than for use; and she could see herself sometimes
in the great round pewter dishes that were ranged on the shelves
above the long deal dinner-table, or in the hobs of the grate,
which always shone like jasper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5394" id="Page_5394">[Pg 5394]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything was looking at its brightest at this moment, for
the sun shone right on the pewter dishes, and from their reflecting
surfaces pleasant jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and
bright brass;&mdash;and on a still pleasanter object than these; for
some of the rays fell on Dinah's finely molded cheek, and lit
up her pale-red hair to auburn, as she bent over the heavy
household linen which she was mending for her aunt. No scene
could have been more peaceful, if Mrs. Poyser, who was ironing
a few things that still remained from the Monday's wash, had
not been making a frequent clinking with her iron, and moving
to and fro whenever she wanted it to cool; carrying the keen
glance of her blue-gray eye from the kitchen to the dairy, where
Hetty was making up the butter, and from the dairy to the
back kitchen, where Nancy was taking the pies out of the oven.
Do not suppose however that Mrs. Poyser was elderly or
shrewish in her appearance; she was a good-looking woman, not
more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion and sandy hair,
well-shapen, light-footed; the most conspicuous article in her
attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which almost covered
her skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than
her cap and gown, for there was no weakness of which she was
less tolerant than feminine vanity, and the preference of ornament
to utility. The family likeness between her and her niece
Dinah Morris, with the contrast between her keenness and
Dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression, might have served a
painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and Mary. Their
eyes were just of the same color, but a striking test of the
difference in their operation was seen in the demeanor of Trip,
the black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected dog unwarily
exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser's
glance. Her tongue was not less keen than her eye, and whenever
a damsel came within earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished
lecture, as a barrel organ takes up a tune, precisely at the
point where it had left off.</p>

<p>The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it
was inconvenient to have the whittaws, and why, consequently,
Mrs. Poyser should scold Molly the housemaid with unusual
severity. To all appearance Molly had got through her after-dinner
work in an exemplary manner, had "cleaned herself"
with great dispatch, and now came to ask submissively if she
should sit down to her spinning till milking-time. But this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5395" id="Page_5395">[Pg 5395]</a></span>
blameless conduct, according to Mrs. Poyser, shrouded a secret
indulgence of unbecoming wishes, which she now dragged forth
and held up to Molly's view with cutting eloquence.</p>

<p>"Spinning, indeed! It isn't spinning as you'd be at, I'll be
bound, and let you have your own way. I never knew your
equals for gallowsness. To think of a gell o' your age wanting
to go and sit with half-a-dozen men! I'd ha' been ashamed to
let the words pass over my lips if I'd been you. And you, as
have been here ever since last Michaelmas, and I hired you
at Treddles'on stattits, without a bit o' character&mdash;as I say, you
might be grateful to be hired in that way to a respectable place;
and you knew no more o' what belongs to work when you come
here than the mawkin i' the field. As poor a two-fisted thing as
ever I saw, you know you was. Who taught you to scrub a
floor, I should like to know? Why, you'd leave the dirt in
heaps i' the corners&mdash;anybody 'ud think you'd never been brought
up among Christians. And as for spinning, why you've wasted as
much as your wage i' the flax you've spoiled learning to spin.
And you've a right to feel that, and not to go about as gaping
and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody. Comb
the wool for the whittaws, indeed! That's what you'd like to
be doing, is it? That's the way with you&mdash;that's the road you'd
all like to go, headlongs to ruin. You're never easy till you've
got some sweetheart as is as big a fool as yourself: you think
you'll be finely off when you're married, I dare say, and have
got a three-legged stool to sit on, and never a blanket to cover
you, and a bit o' oat-cake for your dinner, as three children are
a-snatching at."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I donna want t' go wi' the whittaws," said Molly,
whimpering, and quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her
future; "on'y we allays used to comb the wool for 'n at Mester
Ottley's, an' so I just asked ye. I donna want to set eyes on
the whittaws again; I wish I may never stir if I do."</p>

<p>"Mr. Ottley's, indeed! It's fine talking o' what you did at
Mr. Ottley's. Your missis there might like her floors dirted wi'
whittaws for what I know. There's no knowing what people
<i>wonna</i> like&mdash;such ways as I've heard of! I never had a gell
come into my house as seemed to know what cleaning was; I
think people live like pigs, for my part. And as to that Betty
as was dairymaid at Trent's before she come to me, she'd ha' left
the cheeses without turning from week's end to week's end; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5396" id="Page_5396">[Pg 5396]</a></span>
the dairy thralls, I might ha' wrote my name on 'em, when I
come down-stairs after my illness, as the doctor said it was inflammation&mdash;it
was a mercy I got well of it. And to think o'
your knowing no better, Molly, and been here a-going i' nine
months, and not for want o' talking to, neither;&mdash;and what are
you stanning there for, like a jack as is run down, instead o'
getting your wheel out? You're a rare un for sitting down to
your work a little while after it's time to put by."</p>

<p>"Munny, my iron's twite told; pease put it down to warm."</p>

<p>The small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from
a little sunny-haired girl between three and four, who, seated on
a high chair at the end of the ironing-table, was arduously
clutching the handle of a miniature iron with her tiny fat fist,
and ironing rags with an assiduity that required her to put her
little red tongue out as far as anatomy would allow.</p>

<p>"Cold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face!" said Mrs.
Poyser, who was remarkable for the facility with which she could
relapse from her official objurgatory to one of fondness or of
friendly converse. "Never mind! Mother's done her ironing
now. She's going to put the ironing things away."</p>

<p>"Munny, I tould 'ike to do into de barn to Tommy, to see
de whittawd."</p>

<p>"No, no, no; Totty 'ud get her feet wet," said Mrs. Poyser,
carrying away her iron. "Run into the dairy and see Cousin
Hetty make the butter."</p>

<p>"I tould 'ike a bit of pum-take," rejoined Totty, who seemed
to be provided with several relays of requests; at the same time
taking the opportunity of her momentary leisure to put her
fingers into a bowl of starch and drag it down so as to empty
the contents with tolerable completeness on to the ironing-sheet.</p>

<p>"Did ever anybody see the like?" screamed Mrs. Poyser, running
towards the table when her eye had fallen on the blue
stream. "The child's allays i' mischief if your back's turned a
minute. What shall I do to you, you naughty, naughty gell?"</p>

<p>Totty, however, had descended from her chair with great swiftness,
and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of
waddling run, and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck
which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white sucking
pig.</p>

<p>The starch having been wiped up by Molly's help, and the
ironing apparatus put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5397" id="Page_5397">[Pg 5397]</a></span>
which always lay ready at hand and was the work she liked best,
because she could carry it on automatically as she walked to and
fro. But now she came and sat down opposite Dinah, whom she
looked at in a meditative way, as she knitted her gray worsted
stocking.</p>

<p>"You look th' image o' your Aunt Judith, Dinah, when you
sit a-sewing. I could almost fancy it was thirty years back, and
I was a little gell at home, looking at Judith as she sat at her
work after she'd done the house up; only it was a little cottage,
father's was, and not a big rambling house as gets dirty i' one
corner as fast as you clean it in another; but for all that I could
fancy you was your Aunt Judith, only her hair was a deal darker
than yours, and she was stouter and broader i' the shoulders.
Judith and me allays hung together, though she had such queer
ways, but your mother and her never could agree. Ah! your
mother little thought as she'd have a daughter just cut out after
the very pattern o' Judith, and leave her an orphan too, for Judith
to take care on, and bring up with a spoon when <i>she</i> was in the
grave-yard at Stoniton. I allays said that o' Judith, as she'd bear
a pound weight any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce.
And she was just the same from the first o' my remembering
her; it made no difference in her, as I could see, when she took
to the Methodists, only she talked a bit different, and wore a
different sort o' cap; but she'd never in her life spent a penny
on herself more than keeping herself decent."</p>

<p>"She was a blessed woman," said Dinah: "God had given her
a loving, self-forgetting nature, and he perfected it by grace.
And she was very fond of you too, Aunt Rachel. I've often
heard her talk of you in the same sort of way. When she had
that bad illness, and I was only eleven years old, she used to say,
'You'll have a friend on earth in your Aunt Rachel, if I'm taken
from you; for she has a kind heart;' and I'm sure I've found
it so."</p>

<p>"I don't know how, child; anybody 'ud be cunning to do anything
for you, I think; you're like the birds o' th' air, and live
nobody knows how. I'd ha' been glad to behave to you like a
mother's sister, if you'd come and live i' this country, where
there's some shelter and victual for man and beast, and folks
don't live on the naked hills, like poultry a-scratching on a gravel
bank. And then you might get married to some decent man,
and there'd be plenty ready to have you, if you'd only leave off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5398" id="Page_5398">[Pg 5398]</a></span>
that preaching, as is ten times worse than anything your Aunt
Judith ever did. And even if you'd marry Seth Bede, as is a
poor wool-gathering Methodist, and's never like to have a penny
beforehand, I know your uncle 'ud help you with a pig, and very
like a cow, for he's allays been good-natur'd to my kin, for all
they're poor, and made 'em welcome to the house; and 'ud do
for you, I'll be bound, as much as ever he'd do for Hetty, though
she's his own niece. And there's linen in the house as I could
well spare you, for I've got lots o' sheeting, and table-clothing,
and toweling, as isn't made up. There's a piece o' sheeting I
could give you as that squinting Kitty spun&mdash;she was a rare girl
to spin, for all she squinted and the children couldn't abide her;
and you know the spinning's going on constant, and there's new
linen wove twice as fast as the old wears out. But where's the
use o' talking, if ye wonna be persuaded, and settle down like
any other woman in her senses, i'stead o' wearing yourself out
with walking and preaching, and giving away every penny you
get, so as you've nothing saved against sickness; and all the things
you've got i' the world, I verily believe, 'ud go into a bundle no
bigger nor a double cheese. And all because you've got notions
i' your head about religion more nor what's i' the Catechism and
the Prayer-book."</p>

<p>"But not more than what's in the Bible, Aunt," said Dinah.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the Bible too, for that matter," Mrs. Poyser rejoined
rather sharply; "else why shouldn't them as know best
what's in the Bible&mdash;the parsons and people as have got
nothing to do but learn it&mdash;do the same as you do? But for
the matter o' that, if everybody was to do like you, the world
must come to a standstill; for if everybody tried to do without
house and home, and with poor eating and drinking, and was
allays talking as we must despise the things o' the world, as you
say, I should like to know where the pick o' the stock, and the
corn, and the best new-milk cheeses 'ud have to go. Everybody
'ud be wanting bread made o' tail ends, and everybody 'ud be
running after everybody else to preach to 'em, istead o' bringing
up their families, and laying by against a bad harvest. It
stands to sense as that can't be the right religion."</p>

<p>"Nay, dear Aunt, you never heard me say that all people
are called to forsake their work and their families. It's quite
right the land should be plowed and sowed, and the precious
corn stored, and the things of this life cared for, and right that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5399" id="Page_5399">[Pg 5399]</a></span>
people should rejoice in their families, and provide for them; so
that this is done in the fear of the Lord, and that they are not
unmindful of the soul's wants while they are caring for the body.
We can all be servants of God wherever our lot is cast, but he
gives us different sorts of work, according as he fits us for it and
calls us to it. I can no more help spending my life in trying to
do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help running
if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the
house; the voice would go to your heart, you would think the
dear child was in trouble or in danger, and you couldn't rest
without running to help her and comfort her."</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door,
"I know it 'ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for
hours. You'd make me the same answer, at th' end. I might as
well talk to the running brook, and tell it to stan' still."</p>

<p>The causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now
for Mrs. Poyser to stand there quite pleasantly and see what was
going on in the yard, the gray worsted stocking making a steady
progress in her hands all the while. But she had not been
standing there more than five minutes before she came in again,
and said to Dinah in rather a flurried, awe-stricken tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If there isn't Captain Donnithorne and Mr. Irwine a-coming
into the yard! I'll lay my life they're come to speak about your
preaching on the Green, Dinah; it's you must answer 'em, for
I'm dumb. I've said enough a'ready about your bringing such
disgrace upo' your uncle's family. I wouldn't ha' minded if
you'd been Mr. Poyser's own niece&mdash;folks must put up wi' their
own kin, as they put up wi' their own noses; it's their own flesh
and blood. But to think of a niece o' mine being cause o' my
husband's being turned out of his farm, and me brought him no
fortin but my savins&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, dear Aunt Rachel," said Dinah gently, "you've no
cause for such fears. I've strong assurance that no evil will
happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything
I've done. I didn't preach without direction."</p>

<p>"Direction! I know very well what you mean by direction,"
said Mrs. Poyser, knitting in a rapid and agitated manner.
"When there's a bigger maggot than usial in your head you call
it 'direction'; and then nothing can stir you&mdash;you look like the
statty o' the outside o' Treddles'on church, a-starin' and a-smilin'
whether it's fair weather or foul. I hanna common patience with
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5400" id="Page_5400">[Pg 5400]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and
had got down from their horses: it was plain they meant to
come in. Mrs. Poyser advanced to the door to meet them, curtseying
low, and trembling between anger with Dinah and anxiety
to conduct herself with perfect propriety on the occasion.
For in those days the keenest of bucolic minds felt a whispering
awe at the sight of the gentry, such as of old men felt when
they stood on tiptoe to watch the gods passing by in tall human
shape.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Poyser, how are you after this stormy morning?"
said Mr. Irwine with his stately cordiality. "Our feet are quite
dry; we shall not soil your beautiful floor."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, don't mention it," said Mrs. Poyser. "Will you and
the captain please to walk into the parlor?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, thank you, Mrs. Poyser," said the captain, looking
eagerly round the kitchen, as if his eye were seeking something
it could not find. "I delight in your kitchen. I think it
is the most charming room I know. I should like every farmer's
wife to come and look at it for a pattern."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat," said
Mrs. Poyser, relieved a little by this compliment and the captain's
evident good-humor, but still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine,
who she saw was looking at Dinah and advancing towards her.</p>

<p>"Poyser is not at home, is he?" said Captain Donnithorne,
seating himself where he could see along the short passage to
the open dairy door.</p>

<p>"No, sir, he isn't; he's gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the
factor, about the wool. But there's father i' the barn, sir, if
he'd be of any use."</p>

<p>"No, thank you; I'll just look at the whelps and leave a
message about them with your shepherd. I must come another
day and see your husband; I want to have a consultation with
him about horses. Do you know when he's likely to be at
liberty?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, you can hardly miss him, except it's o' Treddles'on
market-day&mdash;that's of a Friday, you know. For if he's anywhere
on the farm we can send for him in a minute. If we'd
got rid of the Scantlands we should have no outlying fields; and
I should be glad of it, for if ever anything happens he's sure to
be gone to the Scantlands. Things allays happen so contrairy, if
they've a chance; and it's an unnat'ral thing to have one bit o'
your farm in one county and all the rest in another."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5401" id="Page_5401">[Pg 5401]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, the Scantlands would go much better with Choyce's
farm, especially as he wants dairy land and you've got plenty. I
think yours is the prettiest farm on the estate, though; and do
you know, Mrs. Poyser, if I were going to marry and settle, I
should be tempted to turn you out, and do up this fine old
house, and turn farmer myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, "you wouldn't
like it at all. As for farming, it's putting money into your
pocket wi' your right hand and fetching it out wi' your left. As
fur as I can see, it's raising victual for other folks, and just getting
a mouthful for yourself and your children as you go along.
Not as you'd be like a poor man as wants to get his bread: you
could afford to lose as much money as you liked i' farming; but
it's poor fun losing money, I should think, though I understan'
it's what the great folks i' London play at more than anything.
For my husband heard at market as Lord Dacey's eldest son had
lost thousands upo' thousands to the Prince o' Wales, and they
say my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him. But
you know more about that than I do, sir. But as for farming,
sir, I canna think as you'd like it; and this house&mdash;the
draughts in it are enough to cut you through, and it's my opinion
the floors up-stairs are very rotten, and the rats i' the cellar are
beyond anything."</p>

<p>"Why, that's a terrible picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I should
be doing you a service to turn you out of such a place. But
there's no chance of that. I'm not likely to settle for the next
twenty years, till I'm a stout gentleman of forty; and my grandfather
would never consent to part with such good tenants as
you."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if he thinks so well o' Mr. Poyser for a tenant, I
wish you could put in a word for him to allow us some new gates
for the Five Closes, for my husband's been asking and asking till
he's tired; and to think o' what he's done for the farm; and's
never had a penny allowed him, be the times bad or good. And
as I've said to my husband often and often, I'm sure if the captain
had anything to do with it, it wouldn't be so. Not as I
wish to speak disrespectful o' them as have got the power i'
their hands, but it's more than flesh and blood 'ull bear sometimes,
to be toiling and striving, and up early and down late,
and hardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as
the cheese may swell, or the cows may slip their calf, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5402" id="Page_5402">[Pg 5402]</a></span>
wheat may grow green again i' the sheaf&mdash;and after all, at th'
end o' the year, it's like as if you'd been cooking a feast and had
got the smell of it for your pains."</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyser, once launched into conversation, always sailed
along without any check from her preliminary awe of the gentry.
The confidence she felt in her own powers of exposition
was a motive force that overcame all resistance.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were
to speak about the gates, Mrs. Poyser," said the captain; "though
I assure you there's no man on the estate I would sooner say a
word for than your husband. I know his farm is in better order
than any other within ten miles of us; and as for the kitchen,"
he added, smiling, "I don't believe there's one in the kingdom
to beat it. By-the-by, I've never seen your dairy: I must see
your dairy, Mrs. Poyser."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, it's not fit for you to go in, for Hetty's in the
middle o' making the butter, for the churning was thrown late,
and I'm quite ashamed." This Mrs. Poyser said blushing, and
believing that the captain was really interested in her milkpans,
and would adjust his opinion of her to the appearance of
her dairy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no doubt it's in capital order. Take me in," said
the captain, leading the way, while Mrs. Poyser followed.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="POYSER" id="POYSER"></a>MRS. POYSER "HAS HER SAY OUT"</h3>

<h4>From 'Adam Bede'</h4>

<p>Something unwonted must clearly be in the wind, for the old Squire's
visits to his tenantry were rare; and though Mrs. Poyser had during
the last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches, meaning even
more than met the ear, which she was quite determined to make to him
the next time he appeared within the gates of the Hall Farm, the
speeches had always remained imaginary.</p>

<p>"Good-day, Mrs. Poyser," said the old Squire, peering at her with his
short-sighted eyes&mdash;a mode of looking at her which, as Mrs. Poyser
observed, "allays aggravated her: it was as if you was a insect, and
he was going to dab his finger-nail on you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5403" id="Page_5403">[Pg 5403]</a></span></p>

<p>However, she said, "Your servant, sir," and curtsied with an air of
perfect deference as she advanced towards him; she was not the woman
to misbehave towards her betters, and fly in the face of the
Catechism, without severe provocation.</p>

<p>"Is your husband at home, Mrs. Poyser?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he's only i' the rick-yard. I'll send for him in a minute,
if you'll please to get down and step in."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will do so. I want to consult him about a little matter;
but you are quite as much concerned in it, if not more. I must have
your opinion too."</p>

<p>"Hetty, run and tell your uncle to come in," said Mrs. Poyser as they
entered the house, and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to
Hetty's curtsy; while Totty, conscious of a pinafore stained with
gooseberry jam, stood hiding her face against the clock, and peeping
round furtively.</p>

<p>"What a fine old kitchen this is!" said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round
admiringly. He always spoke in the same deliberate, well-chiseled,
polite way, whether his words were sugary or venomous. "And you keep
it so exquisitely clean, Mrs. Poyser. I like these premises, do you
know, beyond any on the estate."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, since you're fond of 'em, I should be glad if you'd let a
bit o' repairs be done to 'em, for the boarding's i' that state as
we're like to be eaten up wi' rats and mice; and the cellar, you may
stan' up to your knees i' water in 't, if you like to go down; but
perhaps you'd rather believe my words. Won't you please to sit down,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; I must see your dairy. I have not seen it for years, and I
hear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter," said the Squire,
looking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which
he and Mrs. Poyser might happen to disagree. "I think I see the door
open there: you must not be surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your
cream and butter. I don't expect that Mrs. Satchell's cream and butter
will bear comparison with yours."</p>

<p>"I can't say, sir, I'm sure. It's seldom I see other folks' butter,
though there's some on it as one's no need to see&mdash;the smell's
enough."</p>

<p>"Ah, now this I like," said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round at the damp
temple of cleanliness, but keeping near the door. "I'm sure I should
like my breakfast better if I knew the butter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5404" id="Page_5404">[Pg 5404]</a></span> and cream came from
this dairy. Thank you, that really is a pleasant sight. Unfortunately,
my slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp; I'll sit
down in your comfortable kitchen. Ah, Poyser, how do you do? In the
midst of business, I see, as usual. I've been looking at your wife's
beautiful dairy: the best manager in the parish, is she not?"</p>

<p>Mr. Poyser had just entered in shirt-sleeves and open waistcoat, with
a face a shade redder than usual, from the exertion of "pitching." As
he stood, red, rotund, and radiant, before the small, wiry, cool old
gentleman, he looked like a prize apple by the side of a withered
crab.</p>

<p>"Will you please to take this chair, sir?" he said, lifting his
father's arm-chair forward a little; "you'll find it easy."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I never sit in easy-chairs," said the old gentleman,
seating himself on a small chair near the door. "Do you know, Mrs.
Poyser&mdash;sit down, pray, both of you&mdash;I've been far from contented, for
some time, with Mrs. Satchell's dairy management. I think she has not
a good method, as you have."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, I can't speak to that," said Mrs. Poyser, in a hard
voice, rolling and unrolling her knitting, and looking icily out of
the window, as she continued to stand opposite the Squire. Poyser
might sit down if he liked, she thought: <i>she</i> wasn't going to sit
down, as if she'd give in to any such smooth-tongued palaver. Mr.
Poyser, who looked and felt the reverse of icy, did sit down in his
three-cornered chair.</p>

<p>"And now, Poyser, as Satchell is laid up, I am intending to let the
Chase Farm to a respectable tenant. I'm tired of having a farm on my
own hands&mdash;nothing is made the best of in such cases, as you know. A
satisfactory bailiff is hard to find; and I think you and I, Poyser,
and your excellent wife here, can enter into a little arrangement in
consequence, which will be to our mutual advantage."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mr. Poyser, with a good-natured blankness of imagination as
to the nature of the arrangement.</p>

<p>"If I'm called upon to speak, sir," said Mrs. Poyser, after glancing
at her husband with pity at his softness, "you know better than me;
but I don't see what the Chase Farm is t' us&mdash;we've cumber enough wi'
our own farm. Not but what I'm glad to hear o' anybody respectable
coming into the parish: there's some as ha' been brought in as hasn't
been looked on i' that character."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5405" id="Page_5405">[Pg 5405]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbor, I assure you:
such a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little
plan I'm going to mention; especially as I hope you will find it as
much to your own advantage as his."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, if it's anything t' our advantage, it'll be the first
offer o' the sort I've heared on. It's them as take advantage that get
advantage i' this world, <i>I</i> think: folks have to wait long enough
afore it's brought to 'em."</p>

<p>"The fact is, Poyser," said the Squire, ignoring Mrs. Poyser's theory
of worldly prosperity, "there is too much dairy land, and too little
plow land, on the Chase Farm, to suit Thurle's purpose&mdash;indeed, he
will only take the farm on condition of some change in it: his wife,
it appears, is not a clever dairywoman like yours. Now, the plan I'm
thinking of is to effect a little exchange. If you were to have the
Hollow Pastures, you might increase your dairy, which must be so
profitable under your wife's management; and I should request you,
Mrs. Poyser, to supply my house with milk, cream, and butter, at the
market prices. On the other hand, Poyser, you might let Thurle have
the Lower and Upper Ridges, which really, with our wet seasons would
be a good riddance for you. There is much less risk in dairy land than
corn land."</p>

<p>Mr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees, his head
on one side, and his mouth screwed up&mdash;apparently absorbed in making
the tips of his fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy
the ribs of a ship. He was much too acute a man not to see through the
whole business, and to foresee perfectly what would be his wife's view
of the subject; but he disliked giving unpleasant answers: unless it
was on a point of farming practice, he would rather give up than have
a quarrel, any day; and after all, it mattered more to his wife than
to him. So, after a few moments' silence, he looked up at her and said
mildly, "What dost say?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity
during his silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss,
looked icily at the opposite roof of the cow-shed, and spearing her
knitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly between her
clasped hands.</p>

<p>"Say? Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any o' your
corn land afore your lease is up, which it won't be for a year come
next Michaelmas, but I'll not consent to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5406" id="Page_5406">[Pg 5406]</a></span> more dairy work into my
hands, either for love or money; and there's nayther love nor money
here, as I can see, on'y other folks' love o' theirselves, and the
money as is to go into other folks' pockets. I know there's them as is
born t' own the land, and them as is born to sweat on 't"&mdash;here Mrs.
Poyser paused to gasp a little&mdash;"and I know it's christened folks'
duty to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood 'ull bear
it; but I'll not make a martyr o' myself, and wear myself to skin and
bone, and worret myself as if I was a churn wi' butter a-coming in 't,
for no landlord in England, not if he was King George himself."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear Mrs. Poyser, certainly not," said the Squire, still
confident in his own powers of persuasion; "you must not overwork
yourself; but don't you think your work will rather be lessened than
increased in this way? There is so much milk required at the Abbey,
that you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from
the addition to your dairy; and I believe selling the milk is the most
profitable way of disposing of dairy produce, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that's true," said Mr. Poyser, unable to repress an opinion on a
question of farming profits, and forgetting that it was not in this
case a purely abstract question.</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Mrs. Poyser bitterly, turning her head
half-way towards her husband, and looking at the
vacant arm-chair&mdash;"I dare say it's true for men as sit i' th'
chimney-corner and make believe as everything's cut wi' ins an' outs
to fit int' everything else. If you could make a pudding wi' thinking
o' the batter, it 'ud be easy getting dinner. How do I know whether
the milk 'ull be wanted constant? What's to make me sure as the house
won't be put o' board wage afore we're many months older, and then I
may have to lie awake o' nights wi' twenty gallons o' milk on my
mind&mdash;and Dingall 'ull take no more butter, let alone paying for it;
and we must fat pigs till we're obliged to beg the butcher on our
knees to buy 'em, and lose half of 'em wi' the measles. And there's
the fetching and carrying, as 'ud be welly half a day's work for a man
an' hoss&mdash;<i>that's</i> to be took out o' the profits, I reckon? But
there's folks 'ud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to carry away
the water."</p>

<p>"That difficulty&mdash;about the fetching and carrying&mdash;you will not have,
Mrs. Poyser," said the Squire, who thought that this entrance into
particulars indicated a distant inclination to com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5407" id="Page_5407">[Pg 5407]</a></span>promise on Mrs.
Poyser's part&mdash;"Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and
pony."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, begging your pardon, I've never been used t' having
gentlefolks' servants coming about my back places, a-making love to
both the gells at once, and keeping 'em with their hands on their hips
listening to all manner o' gossip when they should be down on their
knees a-scouring. If we're to go to ruin, it shanna be wi' having our
back kitchen turned into a public."</p>

<p>"Well, Poyser," said the Squire, shifting his tactics, and looking as
if he thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings
and left the room, "you can turn the Hollows into feeding land. I can
easily make another arrangement about supplying my house. And I shall
not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a
neighbor. I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three
years when the present one expires; otherwise, I dare say, Thurle, who
is a man of some capital, would be glad to take both the farms, as
they could be worked so well together. But I don't want to part with
an old tenant like you."</p>

<p>To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough
to complete Mrs. Poyser's exasperation, even without the final threat.
Her husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the
old place where he had been bred and born&mdash;for he believed the old
Squire had small spite enough for anything&mdash;was beginning a mild
remonstrance explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having
to buy and sell more stock, with&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I think as it's rather hard&mdash;" when Mrs. Poyser burst in
with the desperate determination to have her say out this once, though
it were to rain notices to quit, and the only shelter were the
workhouse.</p>

<p>"Then, sir, if I may speak&mdash;as, for all I'm a woman, and there's folks
as thinks a woman's fool enough to stan' by an' look on while the men
sign her soul away, I've a right to speak, for I make one quarter o'
the rent, and save another quarter&mdash;I say, if Mr. Thurle's so ready to
take farms under you, it's a pity but what he should take this, and
see if he likes to live in a house wi' all the plagues o' Egypt in
't&mdash;wi' the cellar full o' water, and frogs and toads hoppin' up the
steps by dozens&mdash;and the floors rotten, and the rats and mice gnawing
every bit o' cheese, and runnin' over our heads as we lie i' bed till
we expect <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5408" id="Page_5408">[Pg 5408]</a></span>'em to eat us up alive&mdash;as it's a mercy they hanna eat the
children long ago. I should like to see if there's another tenant
besides Poyser as 'ud put up wi' never having a bit o' repairs done
till a place tumbles down&mdash;and not then, on'y wi' begging and praying,
and having to pay half&mdash;and being strung up wi' the rent as it's much
if he gets enough out o' the land to pay, for all he's put his own
money into the ground beforehand. See if you'll get a stranger to lead
such a life here as that: a maggot must be born i' the rotten cheese
to like it, I reckon. You may run away from my words, sir," continued
Mrs. Poyser, following the old Squire beyond the door&mdash;for after the
first moments of stunned surprise he had got up, and waving his hand
towards her with a smile, had walked out towards his pony. But it was
impossible for him to get away immediately, for John was walking the
pony up and down the yard, and was some distance from the causeway
when his master beckoned&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may run away from my words, sir, and you may go spinnin'
underhand ways o' doing us a mischief, for you've got Old Harry to
your friend, though nobody else is; but I tell you for once as we're
not dumb creatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha' got
the lash i' their hands, for want o' knowing how t' undo the tackle.
An' if I'm th' only one as speaks my mind, there's plenty o' the same
way o' thinking i' this parish and the next to 't, for your name 's no
better than a brimstone match in everybody's nose&mdash;if it isna
two-three old folks as you think o' saving your soul by giving 'em a
bit o' flannel and a drop o' porridge. An' you may be right i'
thinking it'll take but little to save your soul, for it'll be the
smallest savin' y' iver made, wi' all your scrapin'."</p>

<p>There are occasions on which two servant-girls and a wagoner may be a
formidable audience, and as the Squire rode away on his black pony,
even the gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him from being
aware that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him.
Perhaps he suspected that sour old John was grinning behind him&mdash;which
was also the fact. Meanwhile the bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier,
Alick's sheep-dog, and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the
pony's heels, carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyser's solo in an
impressive quartet.</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony moved off than she
turned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5409" id="Page_5409">[Pg 5409]</a></span> which drove them
into the back kitchen, and unspearing her knitting, began to knit
again with her usual rapidity, as she re-entered the house.</p>

<p>"Thee'st done it now," said Mr. Poyser, a little alarmed and uneasy,
but not without some triumphant amusement at his wife's outbreak.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I've done it," said Mrs. Poyser; "but I've had my say
out, and I shall be th' easier for 't all my life. There's no pleasure
i' living if you're to be corked up forever, and only dribble your
mind out by the sly like a leaky barrel. I shan't repent saying what I
think, if I live to be as old as th' old Squire; and there's little
likelihoods&mdash;for it seems as if them as aren't wanted here are th'
only folks as aren't wanted i' th' other world."</p>

<p>"But thee wutna like moving from th' old place, this Michaelmas
twelvemonth," said Mr. Poyser, "and going into a strange parish, where
thee know'st nobody. It'll be hard upon us both, and upo' father
too.'"</p>

<p>"Eh, it's no use worreting; there's plenty o' things may happen
between this and Michaelmas twelvemonth. The captain may be master
afore then, for what we know," said Mrs. Poyser, inclined to take an
unusually hopeful view of an embarrassment which had been brought
about by her own merit, and not by other people's fault.</p>

<p>"<i>I'm</i> none for worreting," said Mr. Poyser, rising from his
three-cornered chair, and walking slowly towards the door; "but I
should be loath to leave th' old place, and the parish where I was
bred and born, and father afore me. We should leave our roots behind
us, I doubt, and niver thrive again."</p>

<h3><a name="PRISONERS" id="PRISONERS"></a>THE PRISONERS</h3>

<h4>From 'Romola'</h4>

<p>In 1493 the rumor spread and became louder and louder that
Charles the Eighth of France was about to cross the Alps
with a mighty army; and the Italian populations, accustomed,
since Italy had ceased to be the heart of the Roman empire, to
look for an arbitrator from afar, began vaguely to regard his
coming as a means of avenging their wrongs and redressing their
grievances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5410" id="Page_5410">[Pg 5410]</a></span></p>

<p>And in that rumor Savonarola had heard the assurance that
his prophecy was being verified. What was it that filled the ears
of the prophets of old but the distant tread of foreign armies,
coming to do the work of justice? He no longer looked vaguely
to the horizon for the coming storm: he pointed to the rising
cloud. The French army was that new deluge which was to purify
the earth from iniquity; the French King, Charles VIII, was
the instrument elected by God as Cyrus had been of old, and all
men who desired good rather than evil were to rejoice in his
coming. For the scourge would fall destructively on the impenitent
alone. Let any city of Italy, let Florence above all&mdash;Florence
beloved of God, since to its ear the warning voice had been
specially sent&mdash;repent and turn from its ways like Nineveh of
old, and the storm cloud would roll over it and leave only refreshing
rain-drops.</p>

<p>Fra Girolamo's word was powerful; yet now that the new
Cyrus had already been three months in Italy, and was not far
from the gates of Florence, his presence was expected there with
mixed feelings, in which fear and distrust certainly predominated.
At present it was not understood that he had redressed any
grievances; and the Florentines clearly had nothing to thank him
for. He held their strong frontier fortresses, which Piero de'
Medici had given up to him without securing any honorable terms
in return; he had done nothing to quell the alarming revolt of
Pisa, which had been encouraged by his presence to throw off
the Florentine yoke; and "orators," even with a prophet at their
head, could win no assurance from him, except that he would
settle everything when he was once within the walls of Florence.
Still, there was the satisfaction of knowing that the exasperating
Piero de' Medici had been fairly pelted out for the ignominious
surrender of the fortresses, and in that act of energy the spirit
of the Republic had recovered some of its old fire.</p>

<p>The preparations for the equivocal guest were not entirely
those of a city resigned to submission. Behind the bright drapery
and banners symbolical of joy, there were preparations of
another sort made with common accord by government and
people. Well hidden within walls there were hired soldiers of
the Republic, hastily called in from the surrounding districts;
there were old arms duly furbished, and sharp tools and heavy
cudgels laid carefully at hand, to be snatched up on short notice;
there were excellent boards and stakes to form barricades upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5411" id="Page_5411">[Pg 5411]</a></span>
occasion, and a good supply of stones to make a surprising hail
from the upper windows. Above all, there were people very
strongly in the humor for fighting any personage who might be
supposed to have designs of hectoring over them, they having
lately tasted that new pleasure with much relish. This humor
was not diminished by the sight of occasional parties of Frenchmen,
coming beforehand to choose their quarters, with a hawk,
perhaps, on their left wrist, and metaphorically speaking, a piece
of chalk in their right hand to mark Italian doors withal; especially
as creditable historians imply that many sons of France
were at that time characterized by something approaching to a
swagger, which must have whetted the Florentine appetite for a
little stone-throwing.</p>

<p>And this was the temper of Florence on the morning of the
17th of November, 1494.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The sky was gray, but that made little difference in the
Piazza del Duomo, which was covered with its holiday sky of
blue drapery, and its constellations of yellow lilies and coats of
arms. The sheaves of banners were unfurled at the angles of
the Baptistery, but there was no carpet yet on the steps of the
Duomo, for the marble was being trodden by numerous feet that
were not at all exceptional. It was the hour of the Advent sermons,
and the very same reasons which had flushed the streets
with holiday color were reasons why the preaching in the Duomo
could least of all be dispensed with.</p>

<p>But not all the feet in the Piazza were hastening towards the
steps. People of high and low degree were moving to and fro
with the brisk pace of men who had errands before them; groups
of talkers were thickly scattered, some willing to be late for the
sermon, and others content not to hear it at all.</p>

<p>The expression on the faces of these apparent loungers was
not that of men who are enjoying the pleasant laziness of an
opening holiday. Some were in close and eager discussion; others
were listening with keen interest to a single spokesman, and yet
from time to time turned round with a scanning glance at any new
passer-by. At the corner looking towards the Via de' Cerrettani&mdash;just
where the artificial rainbow light of the Piazza ceased, and
the gray morning fell on the sombre stone houses&mdash;there was a
remarkable cluster of the working people, most of them bearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5412" id="Page_5412">[Pg 5412]</a></span>
on their dress or persons the signs of their daily labor, and
almost all of them carrying some weapon, or some tool which
might serve as a weapon upon occasion. Standing in the gray
light of the street, with bare brawny arms and soiled garments,
they made all the more striking the transition from the brightness
of the Piazza. They were listening to the thin notary, Ser
Cioni, who had just paused on his way to the Duomo. His biting
words could get only a contemptuous reception two years and
a half before in the Mercato; but now he spoke with the more
complacent humor of a man whose party is uppermost, and who
is conscious of some influence with the people.</p>

<p>"Never talk to me," he was saying in his incisive voice,
"never talk to me of bloodthirsty Swiss or fierce French infantry;
they might as well be in the narrow passes of the mountains as
in our streets; and peasants have destroyed the finest armies of
our condottieri in time past, when they had once got them
between steep precipices. I tell you, Florentines need be afraid
of no army in their own streets."</p>

<p>"That's true, Ser Cioni," said a man whose arms and hands
were discolored by crimson dye, which looked like blood-stains,
and who had a small hatchet stuck in his belt; "and those French
cavaliers who came in squaring themselves in their smart doublets
the other day, saw a sample of the dinner we could serve
up for them. I was carrying my cloth in Ognissanti, when I
saw my fine Messeri going by, looking round as if they thought
the houses of the Vespucci and the Agli a poor pick of loadings
for them, and eyeing us Florentines, like top-knotted cocks as
they are, as if they pitied us because we didn't know how to
strut. 'Yes, my fine <i>Galli</i>,' says I, 'stick out your stomachs;
I've got a meat-axe in my belt that will go inside you all the
easier;' when presently the old cow lowed,<a name="FNanchor_A_315" id="FNanchor_A_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_315" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and I knew something
had happened&mdash;no matter what. So I threw my cloth in
at the first doorway, and took hold of my meat-axe and ran
after my fine cavaliers towards the Vigna Nuova. And, 'What
is it, Guccio?' said I, when he came up with me. 'I think it's
the Medici coming back,' said Guccio. <i>Bemb&egrave;!</i> I expected so!
And up we reared a barricade, and the Frenchmen looked behind
and saw themselves in a trap; and up comes a good swarm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5413" id="Page_5413">[Pg 5413]</a></span>
of our <i>Ciompi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_A_316" id="FNanchor_A_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_316" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and one of them with a big scythe he had in his
hand mowed off one of the fine cavaliers' feathers:&mdash;it's true!
And the lasses peppered a few stones down to frighten them.
However, Piero de' Medici wasn't come after all; and it was a
pity; for we'd have left him neither legs nor wings to go away
with again."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, Oddo," said a young butcher, with his knife
at his belt; "and it's my belief Piero will be a good while before
he wants to come back, for he looked as frightened as a hunted
chicken when we hustled and pelted him in the piazza. He's a
coward, else he might have made a better stand when he'd got
his horsemen. But we'll swallow no Medici any more, whatever
else the French king wants to make us swallow."</p>

<p>"But I like not those French cannon they talk of," said Goro,
none the less fat for two years' additional grievances. "San
Giovanni defend us! If Messer Domeneddio means so well by
us as your Frate says he does, Ser Cioni, why shouldn't he have
sent the French another way to Naples?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Goro," said the dyer; "that's a question worth putting.
Thou art not such a pumpkin-head as I took thee for. Why,
they might have gone to Naples by Bologna, eh, Ser Cioni?&mdash;or
if they'd gone to Arezzo&mdash;we wouldn't have minded their going
to Arezzo."</p>

<p>"Fools! It will be for the good and glory of Florence," Ser
Cioni began. But he was interrupted by the exclamation, "Look
there!" which burst from several voices at once, while the faces
were all turned to a party who were advancing along the Via
de' Cerretani.</p>

<p>"It's Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and one of the French noblemen
who are in his house," said Ser Cioni, in some contempt at this
interruption. "He pretends to look well satisfied&mdash;that deep
Tornabuoni&mdash;but he's a Medicean in his heart; mind that."</p>

<p>The advancing party was rather a brilliant one, for there was not only
the distinguished presence of Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and the splendid
costume of the Frenchman with his elaborately displayed white linen
and gorgeous embroidery; there were two other Florentines of high
birth, in handsome dresses donned for the coming procession, and on
the left hand of the Frenchman was a figure that was not to be
eclipsed by any amount of intention or brocade&mdash;a figure we have often
seen before. He wore nothing but black, for he was in mourning; but
the black was presently to be covered by a red mantle, for he too was
to walk in procession as Latin Secretary to the Ten. Tito Melema had
become conspicuously serviceable in the intercourse with the French
guests, from his familiarity with Southern Italy and his readiness in
the French tongue, which he had spoken in his early youth; and he had
paid more than one visit to the French camp at Signa. The lustre of
good fortune was upon him; he was smiling, listening, and explaining,
with his usual graceful unpretentious ease, and only a very keen eye
bent on studying him could have marked a certain amount of change in
him which was not to be accounted for by the lapse of eighteen months.
It was that change which comes from the final departure of moral
youthfulness&mdash;from the distinct self-conscious adoption of a part in
life. The lines of the face were as soft as ever, the eyes as
pellucid; but something was gone&mdash;something as indefinable as the
changes in the morning twilight.</p>

<p>The Frenchman was gathering instructions concerning ceremonial before
riding back to Signa, and now he was going to have a final survey of
the Piazza del Duomo, where the royal procession was to pause for
religious purposes. The distinguished party attracted the notice of
all eyes as it entered the Piazza, but the gaze was not entirely
cordial and admiring; there were remarks not altogether allusive and
mysterious to the Frenchman's hoof-shaped shoes&mdash;delicate flattery of
royal superfluity in toes; and there was no care that certain
snarlings at "Mediceans" should be strictly inaudible. But Lorenzo
Tornabuoni possessed that power of dissembling annoyance which is
demanded in a man who courts popularity, and Tito, besides his natural
disposition to overcome ill-will by good-humor, had the unimpassioned
feeling of the alien towards names and details that move the deepest
passions of the native.</p>

<p>Arrived where they could get a good oblique view of the Duomo, the
party paused. The festoons and devices placed over the central doorway
excited some demur, and Tornabuoni beckoned to Piero di Cosimo, who,
as was usual with him at this hour, was lounging in front of Nello's
shop. There was soon an animated discussion, and it became highly
amusing from the Frenchman's astonishment at Piero's odd pungency of
statement, which Tito translated literally. Even snarling onlookers
became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5415" id="Page_5415">[Pg 5415]</a></span> curious, and their faces began to wear the half-smiling,
half-humiliated expression of people who are not within hearing of the
joke which is producing infectious laughter. It was a delightful
moment for Tito, for he was the only one of the party who could have
made so amusing an interpreter, and without any disposition to
triumphant self-gratulation he reveled in the sense that he was an
object of liking&mdash;he basked in approving glances. The rainbow light
fell about the laughing group, and the grave church-goers had all
disappeared within the walls. It seemed as if the Piazza had been
decorated for a real Florentine holiday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the gray light of the unadorned streets there were
on-comers who made no show of linen and brocade, and whose humor was
far from merry. Here too the French dress and hoofed shoes were
conspicuous, but they were being pressed upon by a large and larger
number of non-admiring Florentines. In the van of the crowd were three
men in scanty clothing; each had his hands bound together by a cord,
and a rope was fastened round his neck and body in such a way that he
who held the extremity of the rope might easily check any rebellious
movement by the threat of throttling. The men who held the ropes were
French soldiers, and by broken Italian phrases and strokes from the
knotted end of the rope, they from time to time stimulated their
prisoners to beg. Two of them were obedient, and to every Florentine
they had encountered had held out their bound hands and said in
piteous tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>"For the love of God and the Holy Madonna, give us something towards
our ransom! We are Tuscans; we were made prisoners in Lunigiana."</p>

<p>But the third man remained obstinately silent under all the strokes of
the knotted cord. He was very different in aspect from his two fellow
prisoners. They were young and hardy, and in the scant clothing which
the avarice of their captors had left them, looked like vulgar, sturdy
mendicants. But he had passed the boundary of old age, and could
hardly be less than four or five and sixty. His beard, which had grown
long in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and straight round his
baldness, were nearly white. His thick-set figure was still firm and
upright, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of
age&mdash;an expression that was partly carried out in the dark eyes and
strong dark eyebrows, which had a strangely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5416" id="Page_5416">[Pg 5416]</a></span> isolated intensity of
color in the midst of his yellow, bloodless, deep-wrinkled face with
its lank gray hairs. And yet there was something fitful in the eyes
which contradicted the occasional flash of energy; after looking round
with quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a
lost and wandering look. But his lips were motionless, and he held his
hands resolutely down. He would not beg.</p>

<p>This sight had been witnessed by the Florentines with growing
exasperation. Many standing at their doors or passing quietly along
had at once given money&mdash;some in half-automatic response to an appeal
in the name of God, others in that unquestioning awe of the French
soldiery which had been created by the reports of their cruel warfare,
and on which the French themselves counted as a guarantee of immunity
in their acts of insolence. But as the group had proceeded farther
into the heart of the city, that compliance had gradually disappeared,
and the soldiers found themselves escorted by a gathering troop of men
and boys, who kept up a chorus of exclamations sufficiently
intelligible to foreign ears without any interpreter. The soldiers
themselves began to dislike their position, for with a strong
inclination to use their weapons, they were checked by the necessity
for keeping a secure hold on their prisoners, and they were now
hurrying along in the hope of finding shelter in a hostelry.</p>

<p>"French dogs!" "Bullock-feet!" "Snatch their pikes from them!" "Cut
the cords and make them run for their prisoners. They'll run as fast
as geese&mdash;don't you see they're web-footed?" These were the cries
which the soldiers vaguely understood to be jeers, and probably
threats. But every one seemed disposed to give invitations of this
spirited kind rather than to act upon them.</p>

<p>"Santiddio! here's a sight!" said the dyer, as soon as he had divined
the meaning of the advancing tumult; "and the fools do nothing but
hoot. Come along!" he added, snatching his axe from his belt, and
running to join the crowd, followed by the butcher and all the rest of
his companions except Goro, who hastily retreated up a narrow passage.</p>

<p>The sight of the dyer, running forward with blood-red arms and axe
uplifted, and with his cluster of rough companions behind him, had a
stimulating effect on the crowd. Not that he did anything else than
pass beyond the soldiers and thrust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5417" id="Page_5417">[Pg 5417]</a></span> himself well among his
fellow-citizens, flourishing his axe; but he served as a stirring
symbol of street-fighting, like the waving of a well-known gonfalon.
And the first sign that fire was ready to burst out was something as
rapid as a little leaping tongue of flame; it was an act of the
conjurer's impish lad Lollo, who was dancing and jeering in front of
the ingenuous boys that made the majority of the crowd. Lollo had no
great compassion for the prisoners, but being conscious of an
excellent knife which was his unfailing companion, it had seemed to
him from the first that to jump forward, cut a rope, and leap back
again before the soldier who held it could use his weapon, would be an
amusing and dexterous piece of mischief. And now, when the people
began to hoot and jostle more vigorously, Lollo felt that his moment
was come: he was close to the eldest prisoner; in an instant he had
cut the cord.</p>

<p>"Run, old one!" he piped in the prisoner's ear, as soon as the cord
was in two; and himself set the example of running as if he were
helped along with wings, like a scared fowl.</p>

<p>The prisoner's sensations were not too slow for him to seize the
opportunity; the idea of escape had been continually present with him,
and he had gathered fresh hope from the temper of the crowd. He ran at
once; but his speed would hardly have sufficed for him if the
Florentines had not instantaneously rushed between him and his captor.
He ran on into the Piazza, but he quickly heard the tramp of feet
behind him, for the other two prisoners had been released, and the
soldiers were struggling and fighting their way after them, in such
tardigrade fashion as their hoof-shaped shoes would allow&mdash;impeded,
but not very resolutely attacked, by the people. One of the two
younger prisoners turned up the Borgo di San Lorenzo, and thus made a
partial diversion of the hubbub; but the main struggle was still
towards the Piazza, where all eyes were turned on it with alarmed
curiosity. The cause could not be precisely guessed, for the French
dress was screened by the impending crowd.</p>

<p>"An escape of prisoners," said Lorenzo Tornabuoni, as he and his party
turned round just against the steps of the Duomo, and saw a prisoner
rushing by them. "The people are not content with having emptied the
Bargello the other day. If there is no other authority in sight they
must fall on the <i>sbirri</i> and secure freedom to thieves. Ah! there is
a French soldier; that is more serious."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5418" id="Page_5418">[Pg 5418]</a></span></p>

<p>The soldier he saw was struggling along on the north side of the
Piazza, but the object of his pursuit had taken the other direction.
That object was the eldest prisoner, who had wheeled round the
Baptistery and was running towards the Duomo, determined to take
refuge in that sanctuary rather than trust to his speed. But in
mounting the steps, his foot received a shock; he was precipitated
towards the group of signori, whose backs were turned to him, and was
only able to recover his balance as he clutched one of them by the
arm.</p>

<p>It was Tito Melema who felt that clutch. He turned his head, and saw
the face of his adoptive father, Baldassarre Calvo, close to his own.</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, silent as death: Baldassarre, with
dark fierceness and a tightening grip of the soiled worn hands on the
velvet-clad arm; Tito, with cheeks and lips all bloodless, fascinated
by terror. It seemed a long while to them&mdash;it was but a moment.</p>

<p>The first sound Tito heard was the short laugh of Piero di Cosimo, who
stood close by him and was the only person that could see his face.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I know what a ghost should be now."</p>

<p>"This is another escaped prisoner," said Lorenzo Tornabuoni. "Who is
he, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"<i>Some madman, surely</i>," said Tito.</p>

<p>He hardly knew how the words had come to his lips: there are moments
when our passions speak and decide for us, and we seem to stand by and
wonder. They carry in them an inspiration of crime, that in one
instant does the work of premeditation.</p>

<p>The two men had not taken their eyes off each other, and it seemed to
Tito, when he had spoken, that some magical poison had darted from
Baldassarre's eyes, and that he felt it rushing through his viens. But
the next instant the grasp on his arm had relaxed, and Baldassarre had
disappeared within the church.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap">oteworthy also," says Carlyle, "and serviceable for the progress
of this same Individual, wilt thou find his subdivision
into Generations."</p>

<p>It is indeed the fact that the course of human history admits of
being marked off into periods, which, from their average duration and
the impulse communicated to them by those who enter upon adolescence
along with them, may be fitly denominated generations, especially
when their opening and closing are signalized by great events
which serve as historical landmarks. No such event, indeed, short of
the Day of Judgment or a universal deluge, can serve as an absolute
line of demarcation; nothing can be more certain than that history
and human life are a perpetual Becoming; and that, although the
progress of development is frequently so startling and unforeseen as
to evoke the poet's exclamation,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"New endless growth surrounds on every side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as we deemed not earth could ever bear."&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>this growth is but development after all. The association of
historical periods with stages in the mental development of man is
nevertheless too convenient to be surrendered; the vision is cleared
and the grasp strengthened by the perception of a well-defined era in
American history, commencing with the election of Andrew Jackson to
the Presidency in 1828 and closing with the death of Abraham Lincoln
in 1865,&mdash;a period exactly corresponding with one in English history
measured from the death of Lord Liverpool, the typical representative
of a bygone political era in the prime of other years, and that of
Lord Palmerston, another such representative, in the latter. The epoch
thus bounded almost precisely corresponds to the productive period of
the two great men who, more than any contemporaries, have stood in the
conscious attitude of teachers of their age. With such men as Tennyson
and Browning, vast as their influence has been, the primary impulse
has not been didactic, but artistic; Herbert Spencer, George Eliot,
Matthew Arnold, and others, have been chiefly operative upon the
succeeding generation; Mill and the elder Newman rather address
special classes than the people at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5422" id="Page_5422">[Pg 5422]</a></span>large; and Ruskin and Kingsley
would have willingly admitted that however eloquent the expression of
their teaching, its originality mainly consisted in the application of
Carlyle's ideas to subjects beyond Carlyle's range. Carlyle and
Emerson, therefore, stand forth like Goethe and Schiller as the
Dioscuri of their period; the two men to whom beyond others its better
minds looked for guidance, and who had the largest share in forming
the minds from which the succeeding generation was to take its
complexion. Faults and errors they had; but on the whole it may be
said that nations have rarely been more fortunate in their instructors
than the two great English-speaking peoples during the age of Carlyle
and Emerson. Of Carlyle this is not the place to speak further; but
writing on Emerson, it will be necessary to exhibit what we conceive
to have been the special value of his teaching; and to attempt some
description of the man himself, in indication of the high place
claimed for him.</p>

<p>It has been said of some great man of marked originality that he was
the sole voice among many echoes. This cannot be said of Emerson; his
age was by no means deficient in original voices. But his may be said
with truth to have been the chief verbal utterance in an age of
authorship. It is a trite remark, that many of the men of thought
whose ideas have most influenced the world have shown little
inclination for literary composition. The president of a London
freethinking club in Goldsmith's time supposed himself to be in
possession of the works of Socrates, no less than of those of "Tully
and Cicero," but no other trace of their existence has come to light.
Had Emerson lived in any age but his own, it is doubtful whether, any
more than Socrates, he would have figured as an author. "I write," he
tells Carlyle, "with very little system, and as far as regards
composition, with most fragmentary result&mdash;paragraphs
incomprehensible, each sentence an infinitely repellent particle." We
also hear of his going forth into the woods to hunt a thought as a boy
might hunt a butterfly, except that the thought had flown with him
from home, and that his business was not so much to capture it as to
materialize it and make it tangible. This peculiarity serves to
classify Emerson among the ancient sages, men like Socrates and
Buddha, whose instructions were not merely oral but unmethodical and
unsystematic; who spoke as the casual emergency of the day dictated,
and left their observations to be collected by their disciples. An
excellent plan in so far as it accomplishes the endowment of the
sage's word with his own individuality; exceptionable when a doubt
arises whether the utterance belongs to the master or the disciple,
and in the case of diametrically opposite versions, whether Socrates
has been represented more truly by the prose of Xenophon or the poetry
of Plato. We may be thankful that the spirit of Emerson's age, and the
exigencies of his own affairs, irresistibly impelled <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5423" id="Page_5423">[Pg 5423]</a></span>him to write:
nevertheless the fact remains that with him Man Thinking is not so
much Man Writing as Man Speaking, and that although the omnipotent
machinery of the modern social system caught him too, and forced him
into line with the rest, we have in him a nearer approach to the
voice, apart from the disturbing and modifying habits of literary
composition, than in any other eminent modern thinker. This annuls one
of the most weighty criticisms upon Emerson, so long as he is regarded
merely as an author,&mdash;his want of continuity, and consequent want of
logic. Had he attempted to establish a philosophical system, this
would have been fatal. But such an undertaking is of all things
furthest from his thoughts. He does not seek to demonstrate, he
announces. Ideas have come to him which, as viewed by the inward
light, appear important and profitable. He brings these forward to be
tested by the light of other men. He does not seek to connect these
ideas together, except in so far as their common physiognomy bespeaks
their common parentage. Nor does he seek to fortify them by reasoning,
or subject them to any test save the faculty by which the unprejudiced
soul discerns good from evil. If his jewel will scratch glass, it is
sufficiently evinced a diamond.</p>

<p>It follows that although Emerson did not write most frequently or best
in verse, he is, as regards the general constitution of his intellect,
rather to be classed with poets than with philosophers. Poetry cannot
indeed dispense with the accurate observation of nature and mankind,
but poetic genius essentially depends on intuition and inspiration.
There is no gulf between the philosopher and the poet; some of the
greatest of poets have also been among the most powerful of reasoners;
but their claim to poetical rank would not have been impaired if their
ratiocination had been ever so illogical. Similarly, a great thinker
may have no more taste for poetry than was vouchsafed to Darwin or the
elder Mill, without any impeachment of his power of intellect. The two
spheres of action are fundamentally distinct, though the very highest
geniuses, such as Shakespeare and Goethe, have sometimes almost
succeeded in making them appear as one. To determine to which of them
a man actually belongs, we must look beyond the externalities of
literary form, and inquire whether he obtains his ideas by intuition,
or by observation and reflection. No mind will be either entirely
intuitive or entirely reflective, but there will usually be a decided
inclination to one or other of the processes; and in the comparatively
few cases in which thoughts and feelings seem to come to it
unconsciously, as leaves to a tree, we may consider that we have a
poet, though perhaps not a writer of poetry. If indeed the man writes
at all, he will very probably write prose, but this prose will be
impregnated with poetic <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5424" id="Page_5424">[Pg 5424]</a></span>quality. From this point of view we are able
to set Emerson much higher than if we regarded him simply as a
teacher. He is greater as the American Wordsworth than as the American
Carlyle. We shall understand his position best by comparing him with
other men of genius who are poets too, but not pre-eminently so. In
beauty of language and power of imagination, John Henry Newman and
James Martineau, though they have written little in verse, yield to
few poets. But throughout all their writings the didactic impulse is
plainly the preponderating one, their poetry merely auxiliary and
ornamental; hence they are not reckoned among poets. With Emerson the
case is reversed: the revealer is first in him, the reasoner second;
oral speech is his most congenial form of expression, and he submits
to appear in print because the circumstances of his age render print
the most effectual medium for the dissemination of his thought. It
will be observed that whenever possible he resorts to the medium of
oration or lecture; it may be further remarked that his essays, often
originally delivered as lectures, are very like his discourses, and
his discourses very like his essays. In neither, so far as regards the
literary form of the entire composition, distinguished from the force
and felicity of individual sentences, can he be considered as a
classic model. The essay need not be too severely logical, yet a just
conception of its nature requires a more harmonious proportion and
more symmetrical construction, as well as a more consistent and
intelligent direction towards a single definite end, than we usually
find in Emerson. The orator is less easy to criticize than the
essayist, for oratory involves an element of personal magnetism which
resists all critical analysis. Hence posterity frequently reverses (or
rather seems to reverse, for the decision upon a speech mutilated of
voice and action cannot be really conclusive) the verdicts of
contemporaries upon oratory. "What will our descendants think of the
Parliamentary oratory of our age?" asked a contemporary of Burke's,
"when they are told that in his own time this man was accounted
neither the first, nor the second, nor even the third speaker?"
Transferred to the tribunal of the library, Burke's oratory bears away
the palm from Pitt and Fox and Sheridan; yet, unless we had heard the
living voices of them all, it would be unsafe for us to challenge the
contemporary verdict. We cannot say, with the lover in Goethe, that
the word printed appears dull and soulless, but it certainly wants
much which conduced to the efficacy of the word spoken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ach wie traurig sieht in Lettern,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Schwarz auf weiss, das Lied mich an,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5425" id="Page_5425">[Pg 5425]</a></span>
Emerson's orations are no less delightful and profitable reading
than his essays, so long as they can be treated as his essays were
intended to be treated when they came into print; that is, read
deliberately, with travelings backward when needed, and frequent
pauses of thought. But if we consider them as discourses to be listened
to, we shall find some difficulty in reconciling their popularity
and influence with their apparent disconnectedness, and some reason
to apprehend that, occasional flashes of epigram excepted, they must
speedily have passed from the minds of the hearers. The apparent
defect was probably remedied in delivery by the magnetic power of
the speaker; not that sort of power which "wields at will the fierce
democracy," but that which convinces the hearer that he is listening
to a message from a region not as yet accessible to himself. The
impassioned orator usually provokes the suspicion that he is speaking
from a brief. Not so Emerson: above all other speakers he inspires
the confidence that he declares a thing to be, not because he wishes,
but because he perceives it to be so. His quiet, unpretending, but
perfectly unembarrassed manner, as of a man with a message which
he simply delivers and goes away, must have greatly aided to supply
the absence of vigorous reasoning and skillful oratorical construction.
We could not expect a spirit commissioned to teach us to condescend
to such methods; and Emerson's discourse, whether in oration or
essay, though by no means deficient in human feeling nor of the
"blessed Glendoveer" order, frequently does sound like that of a
being from another sphere, simply because he derived his ideas
from a higher world; as must always be the case with the man of
spiritual, not of course with the man of practical genius. It matters
nothing whether this is really so, or whether what wears the
aspect of imparted revelation is but a fortifying of the natural eye,
qualifying it to look a little deeper than neighboring eyes into things
around. In either case the person so endowed stands a degree nearer
to the essential truth of things than his fellows; and the consciousness
of the fact, transpiring through his personality, gives him a
weight which might otherwise seem inexplicable. Nothing can be
more surprising than the deference with which the learned and intelligent
contemporaries of the humble and obscure Spinoza resort to
his judgment before he has so much as written a book.</p>

<p>This estimate of Emerson as an American Wordsworth, one who
like Wordsworth not merely enforced but practically demonstrated
the proposition that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One impulse from a vernal wood<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5426" id="Page_5426">[Pg 5426]</a></span>
is controverted by many who can see in him nothing but a polisher
and stringer of epigrammatic sayings. It is impossible to argue with
any who cannot recognize the deep vitality of 'Nature,' of the two
series of Essays first published, and of most of the early orations and
discourses; but it may be conceded that Emerson's fountain of inspiration
was no more perennial than Wordsworth's, and that in his latter
years his gift of epigrammatic statement enabled him to avoid both
the Scylla and the Charybdis of men of genius whose fount of
inspiration has run low. In some such cases, such as Wordsworth's,
the author simply goes on producing, with less and less geniality at
every successive effort. In others, such as Browning's, he escapes
inanity by violent exaggeration of his characteristic mannerisms.
Neither of these remarks applies to Emerson: he does not, in ceasing
to be original, become insipid, nor can it be said that he is any more
mannered at the last than at the first. This is a clear proof that his
peculiarity of speech is not mannerism but manner; that consequently
he is not an artificial writer, and that, since the treatment of his
themes as he has chosen to treat them admits of no compromise
between nature and rhetoric, he has the especial distinction of simplicity
where simplicity is difficult and rare. That such is the case
will appear from an examination of his earlier and more truly prophetic
writings.</p>

<p>Of these, the first in importance as in time is the tract 'Nature,'
commenced in 1833, rewritten, completed, and published in 1836.
Of all Emerson's writings this is the most individual, and the most
adapted for a general introduction to his ideas. These ideas are
not in fact peculiar to him; and yet the little book is one of the
most original ever written, and one of those most likely to effect an
intellectual revolution in the mind capable of apprehending it. The
reason is mainly the intense vitality of the manner, and the translation
of abstract arguments into concrete shapes of witchery and
beauty. It contains scarcely a sentence that is not beautiful,&mdash;not
with the cold beauty of art, but with the radiance and warmth of feeling.
Its dominant note is rapture, like the joy of one who has found
an enchanted realm, or who has convinced himself that old stories
deemed too beautiful to be true are true indeed. Yet it is exempt
from extravagance, the splendor of the language is chastened by
taste, and the gladness and significance of the author's announcements
would justify an even more ardent enthusiasm. They may be
briefly summed up as the statements that Nature is not mechanical,
but vital; that the Universe is not dead, but alive; that God is not
remote, but omnipresent. There was of course no novelty in these
assertions, nor can Emerson bring them by a hair's-breadth nearer
demonstration than they had always been. He simply re-states them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5427" id="Page_5427">[Pg 5427]</a></span>in a manner entirely his own, and with a charm not perhaps surpassing
that with which others had previously invested them, but
peculiar and dissimilar. Everything really Emersonian in Emerson's
teaching may be said to spring out of this little book: so copious,
however, were the corollaries deducible from principles apparently
so simple, that the flowers veiled the tree; and precious as the tract
is, as the first and purest draught of the new wine, it is not the most
practically efficient of his works, and might probably have passed
unperceived if it had not been reinforced by a number of auxiliary
compositions, some produced under circumstances which could not
fail to provoke wide discussion and consequent notoriety. The principles
unfolded in 'Nature' might probably have passed with civil
acquiescence if Emerson had been content with the mere statement;
but he insisted on carrying them logically out, and this could not be
done without unsettling every school of thought at the time prevalent
in America. The Divine omnipresence, for example, was admitted in
words by all except materialists and anti-theists; but if, as Emerson
maintained, this involved the conception of the Universe as a Divine
incarnation, this in its turn involved an optimistic view of the universal
scheme totally inconsistent with the Calvinism still dominant
in American theology. If all existence was a Divine emanation, no
part of it could be more sacred than another part,&mdash;which at once
abolished the mystic significance of religious ceremonies so dear to the
Episcopalians; while the immediate contact of the Universe with the
Deity was no less incompatible with the miraculous interferences on
which Unitarianism reposed its faith. Such were some of the most
important negative results of Emerson's doctrines; in their positive
aspect, by asserting the identity of natural and spiritual laws, they
invested the former with the reverence hitherto accorded only to the
latter, and restored to a mechanical and prosaic society the piety
with which men in the infancy of history had defied the forces of
Nature. Substantially, except for the absence of any definite relation
to literary art, Emerson's mission was very similar to Wordsworth's;
but by natural temperament and actual situation he wanted the
thousand links which bound Wordsworth to the past, and eventually
made the sometime innovator the patron of a return towards the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Emerson had no wish to regress, and, almost alone among thinkers who
have reached an advanced age, betrays no symptom of reaction
throughout the whole of his career. The reason may be, that his
scrupulous fairness and frank conceptions to the Conservative cast of
thought had left him nothing to retract or atone for. He seems to have
started on his journey through life with his Conservatism and
Liberalism ready made up, taking with him just as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5428" id="Page_5428">[Pg 5428]</a></span>much of either as
he wanted. This is especially manifest in the discourse 'The
Conservative' (1841), in which he deliberately weighs conservative
against progressive tendencies, impersonates each in an imaginary
interlocutor, and endeavors to display their respective justification
and shortcomings. Nothing can be more rigidly equitable or more
thoroughly sane than his estimate; and as the issues between
conservatism and reform have broadened and deepened, time has only
added to its value. It is a perfect manual for thoughtful citizens,
desirous of understanding the questions that underlie party issues,
and is especially to be commended to young and generous minds, liable
to misguidance in proportion to their generosity.</p>

<p>This celebrated discourse is one of a group including one still more
celebrated, the address to the graduating class of Divinity College,
Cambridge, published as 'The Christian Teacher' (1838). This, says Mr.
Cabot, seems to have been struck off at a heat, which perhaps accounts
for its nearer approach than any of his other addresses to the
standard of what is usually recognized as eloquence. Eloquent in a
sense Emerson usually was, but here is something which could transport
a fit audience with enthusiasm. It also possessed the power of
awakening the keenest antagonism; but censure has long since died
away, and nothing that Emerson wrote has been more thoroughly adopted
into the creed of those with whom external observances and material
symbols find no place. Equally epoch-making in a different way was the
oration on 'Man Thinking, or the American Scholar' (1837), entitled by
Dr. Holmes "our intellectual Declaration of Independence," and of
which Mr. Lowell says: "We were socially and intellectually moored to
English thought, till Emerson cut the cable and gave us a chance at
the dangers and glories of blue water." In these three great
discourses, and in a less measure in 'The Transcendentalist' and 'Man
the Reformer' (both in 1841), America may boast of possessing works of
the first class, which could have been produced in no other country,
and which&mdash;even though, in Emerson's own phrase, wider circles should
come to be drawn around them&mdash;will remain permanent landmarks in
intellectual history.</p>

<p>These discourses may be regarded as Emerson's public proclamations of
his opinions; but he is probably more generally known and more
intimately beloved by the two unobtrusive volumes of Essays,
originally prefaced for England by Carlyle. Most of these, indeed,
were originally delivered as lectures, but to small audiences, and
with little challenge to public attention. It may be doubted whether
they would have succeeded as lectures but for the personal magnetism
of the speaker; but their very defects aid them with the reader, who,
once fascinated by their beauty of phrase and depth of spiritual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5429" id="Page_5429">[Pg 5429]</a></span>insight, imbibes their spirit all the more fully for his ceaseless
effort to mend their deficient logic with his own. Like Love in
Dante's sonnet, Emerson enters into and blends with the reader, and
his influence will often be found most potent where it is least
acknowledged. Each of the twenty may be regarded as a fuller working
out of some subject merely hinted at in 'Nature,'&mdash;statues, as it
were, for niches left vacant in the original edifice. The most
important and pregnant with thought are 'History,' where the same
claim is preferred for history as for the material world, that it is
not dead but alive; 'Self-Reliance,' a most vigorous assertion of a
truth which Emerson was apt to carry to extremes,&mdash;the majesty of the
individual soul; 'Compensation,' an exposition of the universe as the
incarnation of unerring truth and absolute justice; 'Love,' full of
beauty and rapture, yet almost chilling to the young by its assertion
of what is nevertheless true, that even Love in its human semblance
only subserves ulterior ends; 'Circles,' the demonstration that this
circumstance is no way peculiar to Love, that there can be nothing
ultimate, final, or unrelated to ulterior purpose,&mdash;nothing around
which, in Emersonian phrase, you cannot draw a circle; 'The
Over-Soul,' a prose hymn dedicated to an absolutely spiritual
religion; 'The Poet,' a celebration of Poetry as coextensive with
Imagination, and in the highest sense with Reason also; 'Experience'
and 'Character,' valuable essays, but evincing that the poetical
impulse was becoming spent, and that Emerson's mind was more and more
tending to questions of conduct. The least satisfactory of the essays
is that on 'Art,' where he is only great on the negative side, Art's
inevitable limitations. The &aelig;sthetical faculty, which contemplates
Beauty under the restraints of Form, was evidently weak in him.</p>

<p>'Representative Men,' Emerson's next work of importance (1845), shows
that his parachute was descending; but he makes a highly successful
compromise by taking up original ideas as reflected in the actions and
thoughts of great typical men, one remove only from originality of
exposition on his own part. The treatment is necessarily so partial as
to exercise a distorting influence on his representation of the men
themselves. Napoleon, for example, may have been from a certain point
of view the hero of the middle class, as Emerson chooses to consider
him; but he was much besides, which cannot even be hinted at in a
short lecture. The representation of such a hero, nevertheless,
whether the character precisely fitted Napoleon or not, is highly
spirited and suggestive; and the same may be said of the other
lectures. That on Shakespeare is the least satisfying, the consummate
art which is half Shakespeare's greatness making little appeal to
Emerson. He appears also at variance with himself when he speaks of
Shakespeare's existence as "obscure and profane," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5430" id="Page_5430">[Pg 5430]</a></span>such a healthy,
homely, unambitious life being precisely what he elsewhere extols as a
model. The first lecture of the series, 'Uses of Great Men,' would
seem to have whispered the message more vociferously repeated by Walt
Whitman.</p>

<p>Emerson was yet to write two books of worth, not illumed with "the
light that never was on sea or land," but valuable complements to his
more characteristic work, and important to mankind as an indisputable
proof that a teacher need not be distrusted in ordinary things because
he is a mystic and a poet. 'The Conduct of Life' (1851), far inferior
to his earlier writings in inspiration, is yet one of the most popular
and widely influential of his works because condescending more nearly
to the needs and intelligence of the average reader. It is not less
truly Emersonian, less fully impregnated with his unique genius; but
the themes discussed are less interesting, and the glory and the
beauty of the diction are much subdued. Without it, we should have
been in danger of regarding Emerson too exclusively as a
transcendental seer, and ignoring the solid ground of good sense and
practical sagacity from which the waving forests of his imagery drew
their nutriment. It greatly promoted his fame and influence by coming
into the hands of successive generations of readers who naturally
inquired for his last book, found the author, with surprise, so much
nearer their own intellectual position than they had been led to
expect, and gradually extended the indorsement which they could not
avoid according to the book, to the author himself. When the Reason
and the Understanding have agreed to legitimate the pretensions of a
speculative thinker, these may be considered stable. Emerson
insensibly took rank with the other American institutions; it seemed
natural to all, that without the retractation or modification of a
syllable on his part, Harvard should in 1866 confer her highest honors
upon him whose address to her Divinity School had aroused such fierce
opposition in 1838. Emerson's views, being pure intuitions, rarely
admitted of alteration in essence, though supplement or limitation
might sometimes be found advisable. The Civil War, for instance, could
not but convince him that in his zeal for the independence of the
individual he had dangerously impaired the necessary authority of
government. His attitude throughout this great contest was the ideal
of self-sacrificing patriotism: in truth, it might be said of him, as
of so few men of genius, that you could not find a situation for him,
public or private, whose obligations he was not certain to fulfill. He
had previously given proof of his insight into another nation by his
'English Traits,' mainly founded upon the visit he had paid to England
in 1847-48: a book to be read with equal pleasure and profit by the
nation of which and by the nation for which it was written; while its
insight, sanity, and kindliness justify <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5431" id="Page_5431">[Pg 5431]</a></span>what has been said on
occasion of another of Emerson's writings: "The ideologist judges the
man of action more shrewdly and justly than the man of action judges
the ideologist." This was the secret of Napoleon's bitter animosity to
"ideologists": he felt instinctively that the man of ideas could see
into him and through him, and recognize and declare his place in the
scheme of the universe as an astronomer might a planet's. He would
have wished to be an incalculable, original, elemental force; and it
vexed him to feel that he was something whose course could be mapped
and whose constitution defined by a mere mortal like a Coleridge or a
De Sta&euml;l, who could treat him like the incarnate Thought he was, and
show him, as Emerson showed the banker, "that he also was a phantom
walking and working amid phantoms, and that he need only ask a
question or two beyond his daily questions to find his solid universe
proving dim and impalpable before his sense."</p>

<p>The later writings of Emerson, though exhibiting few or no traces of
mental decay, are in general repetitions or at least confirmations of
what had once been announcements and discoveries. This can scarcely be
otherwise when the mind's productions are derived from its own stuff
and substance. Emerson's contemporary Longfellow could renovate and
indeed augment his poetical power by resort in his old age to Italy;
but change of environment brings no reinforcement of energy to the
speculative thinker. Events however may come to his aid; and when
Emerson was called before the people by a momentous incident like the
death of President Lincoln, he rose fully to the height of the
occasion. His last verses, also, are among his best. We have spoken of
him as primarily and above all things a poet; but his claim to that
great distinction is to be sought rather in the poetical spirit which
informs all his really inspired writings, than in the comparatively
restricted region of rhyme and metre. It might have been otherwise.
Many of his detached passages are the very best things in verse yet
written in America: but though a maker, he is not a fashioner. The
artistic instinct is deficient in him; he is seldom capable of
combining his thoughts into a harmonious whole. No one's expression is
better when he aims at conveying a single thought with gnomic
terseness, as in the mottoes to his essays; few are more obscure when
he attempts continuous composition. Sometimes, as in the admirable
stanzas on the Bunker Hill dedication, the subject has enforced the
due clearness and compression of thought; sometimes, as in the
glorious lines beginning "Not from a vain or shallow thought," he is
guided unerringly by a divine rapture; in one instance at least, 'The
Rhodora,' where he is writing of beauty, the instinct of beauty has
given his lines the symmetry as well as the sparkle of the diamond.
Could he have always written <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5432" id="Page_5432">[Pg 5432]</a></span>like this, he would have been supreme
among American poets in metre; as it is, comparison seems unfair both
to him and to them.</p>

<p>What we have to learn from Emerson is chiefly the Divine immanence in
the world, with all its corollaries; no discovery of his, but
re-stated by him in the fashion most suitable to his age, and with a
cogency and attractiveness rivaled by no contemporary. If we tried to
sum up his message in a phrase, we might perhaps find this in Keats's
famous 'Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty'; only, while Keats was
evidently more concerned for Beauty than for Truth, Emerson held an
impartial balance. These are with him the tests of each other:
whatever is really true is also beautiful, whatever is really
beautiful is also true. Hence his especial value to a world whose more
refined spirits are continually setting up types of &aelig;sthetic beauty
which must needs be delusive, as discordant with beauty contemplated
under the aspect of morality; while the mass never think of bringing
social and political arrangements to the no less infallible test of
conformity to an ideally beautiful standard. Hence the seeming
idealist is of all men the most practical; and Emerson's gospel of
beauty should be especially precious to a country like his own, where
circumstances must for so long tell in favor of the more material
phases of civilization. Even more important is that aspect of his
teaching which deals with the unalterableness of spiritual laws, the
impossibility of evading Truth and Fact in the long run, or of
wronging any one without at the same time wronging oneself. Happy
would it be for the United States if Emerson's essay on 'Compensation'
in particular could be impressed upon the conscience, where there is
any, of every political leader; and interwoven with the very texture
of the mind of every one who has a vote to cast at the polls!</p>

<p>The special adaptation of Emerson's teaching to the needs of America
is, nevertheless, far from the greatest obligation under which he has
laid his countrymen. His greatest service is to have embodied a
specially American type of thought and feeling. It is the test of real
greatness in a nation to be individual, to produce something in the
world of intellect peculiar to itself and indefeasibly its own. Such
intellectual growths were indeed to be found in America before
Emerson's time, but they were not of the highest class. Franklin was a
great sage, but his wisdom was worldly wisdom. Emerson gives us, in
his own phrase, morality on fire with emotion,&mdash;the only morality
which in the long run will really influence the heart of man. Man is
after all too noble a being to be permanently actuated by enlightened
selfishness; and when we compare Emerson with even so truly eminent a
character as Franklin, we see, as he saw when he compared Carlyle with
Johnson, how great a stride <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5433" id="Page_5433">[Pg 5433]</a></span>forward his country had taken in the mean
time. But he could do for America what Carlyle could not do for Great
Britain, for it was done already: he could and did create a type of
wisdom especially national, as distinctive of the West as Buddha's of
the East.</p>

<h3><a name="TIMES" id="TIMES"></a>THE TIMES</h3>

<h4>From the Lecture on 'The Times,' 1841</h4>

<p>But the subject of the Times is not an abstract question. We talk of
the world, but we mean a few men and women. If you speak of the age,
you mean your own platoon of people, as Dante and Milton painted in
colossal their platoons, and called them Heaven and Hell. In our idea
of progress we do not go out of this personal picture. We do not think
the sky will be bluer, or honey sweeter, or our climate more
temperate, but only that our relation to our fellows will be simpler
and happier. What is the reason to be given for this extreme
attraction which <i>persons</i> have for us, but that they are the Age?
They are the results of the Past; they are the heralds of the Future.
They indicate&mdash;these witty, suffering, blushing, intimidating figures
of the only race in which there are individuals or changes&mdash;how far on
the Fate has gone, and what it drives at. As trees make scenery, and
constitute the hospitality of the landscape, so persons are the world
to persons.... These are the pungent instructors who thrill the heart
of each of us, and make all other teaching formal and cold. How I
follow them with aching heart, with pining desire! I count myself
nothing before them. I would die for them with joy. They can do what
they will with me. How they lash us with those tongues! How they make
the tears start, make us blush and turn pale, and lap us in Elysium to
soothing dreams and castles in the air! By tones of triumph, of dear
love, by threats, by pride that freezes, these have the skill to make
the world look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5434" id="Page_5434">[Pg 5434]</a></span> bleak and inhospitable, or seem the nest of tenderness
and joy. I do not wonder at the miracles which poetry attributes to
the music of Orpheus, when I remember what I have experienced from the
varied notes of the human voice. They are an incalculable energy which
countervails all other forces in nature, because they are the channel
of supernatural powers. There is no interest or institution so poor
and withered but if a new strong man could be born into it he would
immediately redeem and replace it. A personal ascendency,&mdash;that is the
only fact much worth considering. I remember, some years ago, somebody
shocked a circle of friends of order here in Boston, who supposed that
our people were identified with their religious denominations, by
declaring that an eloquent man&mdash;let him be of what sect soever&mdash;would
be ordained at once in one of our metropolitan churches. To be sure he
would; and not only in ours but in any church, mosque, or temple on
the planet: but he must be eloquent, able to supplant our method and
classification by the superior beauty of his own. Every fact we have
was brought here by some person; and there is none that will not
change and pass away before a person whose nature is broader than the
person whom the fact in question represents. And so I find the Age
walking about in happy and hopeful natures, in strong eyes and
pleasant thoughts, and think I read it nearer and truer so than in the
statute-book, or in the investments of capital, which rather celebrate
with mournful music the obsequies of the last age. In the brain of a
fanatic; in the wild hope of a mountain boy, called by city boys very
ignorant, because they do not know what his hope has certainly
apprised him shall be; in the love-glance of a girl; in the
hair-splitting conscientiousness of some eccentric person who has
found some new scruple to embarrass himself and his neighbors
withal,&mdash;is to be found that which shall constitute the times to come,
more than in the now organized and accredited oracles. For whatever is
affirmative and now advancing contains it. I think that only is real
which men love and rejoice in; not what they tolerate, but what they
choose; what they embrace and avow, and not the things which chill,
benumb, and terrify them.</p>

<p>And so why not draw for these times a portrait gallery? Let us paint
the painters. Whilst the daguerreotypist, with camera-obscura and
silver plate, begins now to traverse the land, let us set up our
camera also, and let the sun paint the people. Let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5435" id="Page_5435">[Pg 5435]</a></span> us paint the
agitator, and the man of the old school, and the member of Congress,
and the college professor, the formidable editor, the priest, and
reformer, the contemplative girl, and the fair aspirant for fashion
and opportunities, the woman of the world who has tried and knows&mdash;let
us examine how well she knows. Could we indicate the indicators,
indicate those who most accurately represent every good and evil
tendency of the general mind, in the just order which they take on
this canvas of time, so that all witnesses should recognize a
spiritual law, as each well-known form flitted for a moment across the
wall, we should have a series of sketches which would report to the
next ages the color and quality of ours.</p>

<p>Certainly I think if this were done there would be much to admire as
well as to condemn; souls of as lofty a port as any in Greek or Roman
fame might appear; men of great heart, of strong hand, and of
persuasive speech; subtle thinkers, and men of wide sympathy, and an
apprehension which looks over all history and everywhere recognizes
its own. To be sure, there will be fragments and hints of men, more
than enough; bloated promises, which end in nothing or little. And
then, truly great men, but with some defect in their composition which
neutralizes their whole force. Here is a Damascus blade, such as you
may search through nature in vain to parallel, laid up on the shelf in
some village to rust and ruin. And how many seem not quite available
for that idea which they represent! Now and then comes a bolder
spirit, I should rather say, a more surrendered soul, more informed
and led by God, which is much in advance of the rest, quite beyond
their sympathy, but predicts what shall soon be the general fullness;
as when we stand by the sea-shore, whilst the tide is coming in, a
wave comes up the beach far higher than any foregoing one, and
recedes; and for a long while none comes up to that mark; but after
some time the whole sea is there and beyond it.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="FRIENDSHIP" id="FRIENDSHIP"></a>FRIENDSHIP</h3>

<p>Friendship may be said to require natures so rare and costly, each so
well tempered and so happily adapted, and withal so circumstanced (for
even in that particular, a poet says, love demands that the parties be
altogether paired), that its satisfaction can very seldom be assured.
It cannot subsist in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5436" id="Page_5436">[Pg 5436]</a></span> perfection, say some of those who are
learned in this warm lore of the heart, betwixt more than two. I am
not quite so strict in my terms, perhaps because I have never known so
high a fellowship as others. I please my imagination more with a
circle of godlike men and women variously related to each other, and
between whom subsists a lofty intelligence. But I find this law of
<i>one to one</i> peremptory for conversation, which is the practice and
consummation of friendship. Do not mix waters too much. The best mix
as ill as good and bad. You shall have very useful and cheering
discourse at several times with two several men, but let all three of
you come together and you shall not have one new and hearty word. Two
may talk and one may hear, but three cannot take part in a
conversation of the most sincere and searching sort. In good company
there is never such discourse between two, across the table, as takes
place when you leave them alone. In good company the individuals merge
their egotism into a social soul exactly coextensive with the several
consciousnesses there present....</p>

<p>Unrelated men give little joy to each other, will never suspect the
latent powers of each. We talk sometimes of a great talent for
conversation, as if it were a permanent property in some individuals.
Conversation is an evanescent relation,&mdash;no more. A man is reputed to
have thought and eloquence; he cannot, for all that, say a word to his
cousin or his uncle. They accuse his silence with as much reason as
they would blame the insignificance of a dial in the shade. In the sun
it will mark the hour. Among those who enjoy his thought he will
regain his tongue.</p>

<p>Friendship requires that rare mean betwixt likeness and unlikeness
that piques each with the presence of power and of consent in the
other party. Let me be alone to the end of the world, rather than that
my friend should overstep, by a word or a look, his real sympathy. I
am equally balked by antagonism and by compliance. Let him not cease
an instant to be himself. The only joy I have in his being mine, is
that the <i>not mine</i> is <i>mine</i>. I hate, where I looked for a manly
furtherance or at least a manly resistance, to find a mush of
concession. Better be a nettle in the side of your friend than his
echo. The condition which high friendship demands is ability to do
without it. That high office requires great and sublime parts. There
must be very two before there can be very one. Let it be an alliance
of two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5437" id="Page_5437">[Pg 5437]</a></span> large, formidable natures, mutually beheld, mutually feared,
before yet they recognize the deep identity which beneath these
disparities unites them.</p>

<p>He only is fit for this society who is magnanimous; who is sure that
greatness and goodness are always economy; who is not swift to
intermeddle with his fortunes. Let him not intermeddle with this.
Leave to the diamond its ages to grow, nor expect to accelerate the
births of the eternal. Friendship demands a religious treatment. We
talk of choosing our friends, but friends are self-elected. Reverence
is a great part of it. Treat your friend as a spectacle. Of course he
has merits that are not yours, and that you cannot honor if you must
needs hold him close to your person. Stand aside; give those merits
room; let them mount and expand. Are you the friend of your friend's
buttons, or of his thought? To a great heart he will still be a
stranger in a thousand particulars, that he may come near in the
holiest ground. Leave it to girls and boys to regard a friend as
property, and to such a short and all-confounding pleasure instead of
the noblest benefit.</p>

<p>Let us buy our entrance to this guild by a long probation. Why should
we desecrate noble and beautiful souls by intruding on them? Why
insist on rash personal relations with your friend? Why go to his
house, or know his mother and brother and sisters? Why be visited by
him at your own? Are these things material to our covenant? Leave this
touching and clawing. Let him be to me a spirit. A message, a thought,
a sincerity, a glance from him, I want; but not news, nor pottage. I
can get politics and chat and neighborly conveniences from cheaper
companions. Should not the society of my friend be to me poetic, pure,
universal, and great as nature itself? Ought I to feel that our tie is
profane in comparison with yonder bar of cloud that sleeps on the
horizon, or that clump of waving grass that divides the brook? Let us
not vilify, but raise it to that standard. That great defying eye,
that scornful beauty of his mien and action, do not pique yourself on
reducing, but rather fortify and enhance. Worship his superiorities;
wish him not less by a thought, but hoard and tell them all. Let him
be to thee forever a sort of beautiful enemy, untamable, devoutly
revered, and not a trivial conveniency to be soon outgrown and cast
aside. The hues of the opal, the light of the diamond, are not to be
seen if the eye is too near. To my friend I write a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5438" id="Page_5438">[Pg 5438]</a></span> letter and from
him I receive a letter. That seems to you a little. It suffices me. It
is a spiritual gift, worthy of him to give and of me to receive. It
profanes nobody. In these warm lines the heart will trust itself, as
it will not to the tongue, and pour out the prophecy of a godlier
existence than all the annals of heroism have yet made good....</p>

<p>The higher the style we demand of friendship, of course the less easy
to establish it with flesh and blood. We walk alone in the world.
Friends such as we desire are dreams and fables. But a sublime hope
cheers ever the faithful heart, that elsewhere, in other regions of
the universal power, souls are now acting, enduring, and daring, which
can love us and which we can love. We may congratulate ourselves that
the period of nonage, of follies, of blunders and of shame, is passed
in solitude, and when we are finished men we shall grasp heroic hands
in heroic hands. Only be admonished by what you already see, not to
strike leagues of friendship with cheap persons, where no friendship
can be. Our impatience betrays us into rash and foolish alliances
which no god attends. By persisting in your path, though you forfeit
the little you gain the great.</p>

<h3><a name="NATURE" id="NATURE"></a>NATURE</h3>

<p>There are days which occur in this climate, at almost any season of
the year, wherein the world reaches its perfection; when the air, the
heavenly bodies, and the earth, make a harmony, as if nature would
indulge her offspring; when, in these bleak upper sides of the planet,
nothing is to desire that we have heard of the happiest latitudes, and
we bask in the shining hours of Florida and Cuba; when everything that
has life gives sign of satisfaction, and the cattle that lie on the
ground seem to have great and tranquil thoughts. These halcyons may be
looked for with a little more assurance in that pure October weather
which we distinguish by the name of the Indian Summer. The day,
immeasurably long, sleeps over the broad hills and warm wide fields.
To have lived through all its sunny hours seems longevity enough. The
solitary places do not seem quite lonely. At the gates of the forest,
the surprised man of the world is forced to leave his city estimates
of great and small, wise and foolish. The knapsack of custom falls off
his back with the first step he takes into these precincts. Here is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5439" id="Page_5439">[Pg 5439]</a></span>
sanctity which shames our religions, and reality which discredits our
heroes. Here we find nature to be the circumstance which dwarfs every
other circumstance, and judges like a god all men that come to her. We
have crept out of our close and crowded houses into the night and
morning, and we see what majestic beauties daily wrap us in their
bosom. How willingly we would escape the barriers which render them
comparatively impotent, escape the sophistication and second thought,
and suffer nature to intrance us. The tempered light of the woods is
like a perpetual morning, and is stimulating and heroic. The anciently
reported spells of these places creep on us. The stems of pines,
hemlocks, and oaks almost gleam like iron on the excited eye. The
incommunicable trees begin to persuade us to live with them, and quit
our life of solemn trifles. Here no history, or church, or state, is
interpolated on the divine sky and the immortal year. How easily we
might walk onward into the opening landscape, absorbed by new pictures
and by thoughts fast succeeding each other, until by degrees the
recollection of home was crowded out of the mind, all memory
obliterated by the tyranny of the present, and we were led in triumph
by nature.</p>

<p>These enchantments are medicinal; they sober and heal us. These are
plain pleasures, kindly and native to us. We come to our own, and make
friends with matter which the ambitious chatter of the schools would
persuade us to despise. We never can part with it; the mind loves its
old home: as water to our thirst, so is the rock, the ground, to our
eyes and hands and feet. It is firm water; it is cold flame: what
health, what affinity! Ever an old friend, ever like a dear friend and
brother when we chat affectedly with strangers, comes in this honest
face, and takes a grave liberty with us, and shames us out of our
nonsense. Cities give not the human senses room enough. We go out
daily and nightly to feed the eyes on the horizon, and require so much
scope, just as we need water for our bath. There are all degrees of
natural influence, from these quarantine powers of nature, up to her
dearest and gravest ministrations to the imagination and the soul.
There is the bucket of cold water from the spring, the wood fire to
which the chilled traveler rushes for safety,&mdash;and there is the
sublime moral of autumn and of noon. We nestle in nature, and draw our
living as parasites from her roots and grains; and we receive glances
from the heavenly bodies, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5440" id="Page_5440">[Pg 5440]</a></span> call us to solitude, and foretell the
remotest future. The blue zenith is the point in which romance and
reality meet. I think if we should be rapt away into all that we dream
of heaven, and should converse with Gabriel and Uriel, the upper sky
would be all that would remain of our furniture.</p>

<p>It seems as if the day was not wholly profane, in which we have given
heed to some natural object. The fall of snowflakes in a still air,
preserving to each crystal its perfect form; the blowing of sleet over
a wide sheet of water, and over plains; the waving rye field; the
mimic waving of acres of houstonia, whose innummerable florets whiten
and ripple before the eye; the reflections of trees and flowers in
glassy lakes; the musical steaming odorous south wind, which converts
all trees to wind-harps; the crackling and spurting of hemlock in the
flames, or of pine logs, which yield glory to the walls and faces in
the sitting-room,&mdash;these are the music and pictures of the most
ancient religion. My house stands in low land, with limited outlook,
and on the skirt of the village. But I go with my friend to the shore
of our little river, and with one stroke of the paddle I leave the
village politics and personalities,&mdash;yes, and the world of villages
and personalities,&mdash;behind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset
and moonlight, too bright almost for spotted man to enter without
novitiate and probation. We penetrate bodily this incredible beauty;
we dip our hands in this painted element; our eyes are bathed in these
lights and forms. A holiday, a villeggiatura, a royal revel, the
proudest, most heart-rejoicing festival that valor and beauty, power
and taste, ever decked and enjoyed, establishes itself on the instant.
These sunset clouds, these delicately emerging stars, with their
private and ineffable glances, signify it and proffer it. I am taught
the poorness of our invention, the ugliness of towns and palaces. Art
and luxury have early learned that they must work as enchantment and
sequel to this original beauty. I am over-instructed for my return.
Henceforth I shall be hard to please. I cannot go back to toys. I am
grown expensive and sophisticated. I can no longer live without
elegance; but a countryman shall be my master of revels. He who knows
the most, he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the
waters, the plants, the heavens, and how to come at these
enchantments, is the rich and royal man. Only as far as the masters of
the world have called in nature to their aid, can they reach the
height of magnificence.</p>

<h3><a name="COMPENSATION" id="COMPENSATION"></a>COMPENSATION</h3>

<p>A man cannot speak but he judges himself. With his will or against his
will, he draws his portrait to the eye of his companions by every
word. Every opinion reacts on him who utters it. It is a thread-ball
thrown at a mark, but the other end remains in the thrower's bag. Or
rather, it is a harpoon thrown at the whale, unwinding, as it flies, a
coil of cord in the boat; and if the harpoon is not good, or not well
thrown, it will go nigh to cut the steersman in twain or to sink the
boat.</p>

<p>You cannot do wrong without suffering wrong. "No man had ever a point
of pride that was not injurious to him," said Burke. The exclusive in
fashionable life does not see that he excludes himself from enjoyment,
in the attempt to appropriate it. The exclusionist in religion does
not see that he shuts the door of heaven on himself, in striving to
shut out others. Treat men as pawns and ninepins, and you shall suffer
as well as they. If you leave out their heart, you shall lose your
own. The senses would make things of all persons; of women, of
children, of the poor. The vulgar proverb "I will get it from his
purse or get it from his skin," is sound philosophy.</p>

<p>All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are
speedily punished. They are punished by fear. Whilst I stand in simple
relations to my fellow-man, I have no displeasure in meeting him. We
meet as water meets water, or as two currents of air mix,&mdash;with
perfect diffusion and interpenetration of nature. But as soon as there
is any departure from simplicity, and attempt at halfness, or good for
me that is not good for him, my neighbor feels the wrong; he shrinks
from me as far as I have shrunk from him; his eyes no longer seek
mine; there is war between us; there is hate in him and fear in me.</p>

<p>All the old abuses in society, universal and particular, all unjust
accumulations of property and power, are avenged in the same manner.
Fear is an instructor of great sagacity, and the herald of all
revolutions. One thing he teaches,&mdash;that there is rottenness where he
appears. He is a carrion crow; and though you see not well what he
hovers for, there is death somewhere. Our property is timid, our laws
are timid, our cultivated classes are timid. Fear for ages has boded
and mowed and gibbered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5442" id="Page_5442">[Pg 5442]</a></span> over government and property. That obscene
bird is not there for nothing. He indicates great wrongs which must be
revised.</p>

<p>Of the like nature is that expectation of change which instantly
follows the suspension of our voluntary activity. The terror of
cloudless noon, the emerald of Polycrates, the awe of prosperity, the
instinct which leads every generous soul to impose on itself tasks of
a noble asceticism and vicarious virtue, are the tremblings of the
balance of justice through the heart and mind of man.</p>

<p>Experienced men of the world know very well that it is best to pay
scot and lot as they go along, and that a man often pays dear for a
small frugality. The borrower runs in his own debt. Has a man gained
anything who has received a hundred favors and rendered none? Has he
gained by borrowing, through indolence or cunning, his neighbor's
wares, or horses, or money? There arises on the deed the instant
acknowledgment of benefit on the one part and of debt on the other;
that is, of superiority and inferiority. The transaction remains in
the memory of himself and his neighbor, and every new transaction
alters according to its nature their relation to each other. He may
soon come to see that he had better have broken his own bones than to
have ridden in his neighbor's coach, and that "the highest price he
can pay for a thing is to ask for it."</p>

<p>A wise man will extend this lesson to all parts of life, and know that
it is the part of prudence to face every claimant and pay every just
demand on your time, your talents, or your heart. Always pay; for
first or last you must pay your entire debt. Persons and events may
stand for a time between you and justice, but it is only a
postponement. You must pay at last your own debt. If you are wise, you
will dread a prosperity which only loads you with more. Benefit is the
end of nature. But for every benefit which you receive, a tax is
levied. He is great who confers the most benefits. He is base&mdash;and
that is the one base thing in the universe&mdash;to receive favors and
render none. In the order of nature we cannot render benefits to those
from whom we receive them, or only seldom. But the benefit we receive
must be rendered again, line for line, deed for deed, cent for cent,
to somebody. Beware of too much good staying in your hand. It will
fast corrupt and worm worms. Pay it away quickly in some sort.</p>

<h3><a name="LOVE" id="LOVE"></a>LOVE</h3>

<p>Here let us examine a little nearer the nature of that influence which
is thus potent over the human youth. Beauty, whose revelation to man
we now celebrate, welcome as the sun wherever it pleases to shine,
which pleases everybody with it and with themselves, seems sufficient
to itself. The lover cannot paint his maiden to his fancy poor and
solitary. Like a tree in flower, so much soft, budding, informing
loveliness is society for itself; and she teaches his eye why Beauty
was pictured with Loves and Graces attending her steps. Her existence
makes the world rich. Though she extrudes all other persons from his
attention as cheap and unworthy, she indemnifies him by carrying out
her own being into somewhat impersonal, large mundane, so that the
maiden stands to him for a representative of all select things and
virtues. For that reason the lover never sees personal resemblances in
his mistress to her kindred or to others. His friends find in her a
likeness to her mother, or her sisters, or to persons not of her
blood. The lover sees no resemblance except to summer evenings and
diamond mornings, to rainbows and the song of birds.</p>

<p>The ancients called beauty the flowering of virtue. Who can analyze
the nameless charm which glances from one and another face and form?
We are touched with emotions of tenderness and complacency, but we
cannot find whereat this dainty emotion, this wandering gleam, points.
It is destroyed for the imagination by any attempt to refer it to
organization. Nor does it point to any relations of friendship or love
known and described in society; but as it seems to me, to a quite
other and unattainable sphere, to relations of transcendent delicacy
and sweetness, to what roses and violets hint and foreshow. We cannot
approach beauty. Its nature is like opaline dove's-neck lustres,
hovering and evanescent. Herein it resembles the most excellent
things, which all have this rainbow character, defying all attempts at
appropriation and use. What else did Jean Paul Richter signify when he
said to music, "Away! away! thou speakest to me of things which in all
my endless life I have not found and shall not find." The same fluency
may be observed in every work of the plastic arts. The statue is then
beautiful when it begins to be incomprehensible, when it is passing
out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5444" id="Page_5444">[Pg 5444]</a></span> criticism and can no longer be defined by compass and
measuring wand, but demands an active imagination to go with it and to
say what it is in the act of doing. The god or hero of the sculptor is
always represented in a transition <i>from</i> that which is representable
to the senses, <i>to</i> that which is not. Then first it ceases to be a
stone. The same remark holds of painting. And of poetry the success is
not attained when it lulls and satisfies, but when it astonishes and
fires us with new endeavors after the unattainable. Concerning it
Landor inquires "whether it is not to be referred to some purer state
of sensation and existence."</p>

<p>In like manner personal beauty is then first charming and itself when
it dissatisfies us with any end; when it becomes a story without an
end; when it suggests gleams and visions and not earthly
satisfactions; when it makes the beholder feel his unworthiness; when
he cannot feel his right to it, though he were C&aelig;sar; he cannot feel
more right to it than to the firmament and the splendors of a sunset.</p>

<p>Hence arose the saying, "If I love you, what is that to you?" We say
so because we feel that what we love is not in your will, but above
it. It is not you, but your radiance. It is that which you know not in
yourself and can never know.</p>

<p>This agrees well with that high philosophy of Beauty which the ancient
writers delighted in; for they said that the soul of man, embodied
here on earth, went roaming up and down in quest of that other world
of its own out of which it came into this, but was soon stupefied by
the light of the natural sun, and unable to see any other objects than
those of this world, which are but shadows of real things. Therefore
the Deity sends the glory of youth before the soul, that it may avail
itself of beautiful bodies as aids to its recollection of the
celestial good and fair; and the man beholding such a person in the
female sex runs to her and finds the highest joy in contemplating the
form, movement, and intelligence of this person, because it suggests
to him the presence of that which indeed is within the beauty, and the
cause of the beauty.</p>

<p>If however, from too much conversing with material objects, the soul
was gross, and misplaced its satisfaction in the body, it reaped
nothing but sorrow; body being unable to fulfill the promise which
beauty holds out; but if, accepting the hint of these visions and
suggestions which beauty makes to his mind, the soul passes through
the body and falls to admire strokes of character,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5445" id="Page_5445">[Pg 5445]</a></span> and the lovers
contemplate one another in their discourses and their actions, then
they pass to the true palace of beauty, more and more inflame their
love of it, and by this love extinguishing the base affection, as the
sun puts out fire by shining on the hearth, they become pure and
hallowed. By conversation with that which is in itself excellent,
magnanimous, lowly, and just, the lover comes to a warmer love of
these nobilities and a quicker apprehension of them. Then he passes
from loving them in one to loving them in all, and so is the one
beautiful soul only the door through which he enters to the society of
all true and pure souls. In the particular society of his mate he
attains a clearer sight of any spot, any taint which her beauty has
contracted from this world, and is able to point it out; and this with
mutual joy that they are now able without offense to indicate
blemishes and hindrances in each other, and give to each all help and
comfort in curing the same. And beholding in many souls the traits of
the divine beauty, and separating in each soul that which is divine
from the taint which it has contracted in the world, the lover ascends
to the highest beauty, to the love and knowledge of the Divinity, by
steps on this ladder of created souls.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="CIRCLES" id="CIRCLES"></a>CIRCLES</h3>

<p>The eye is the first circle; the horizon which it forms is the second;
and throughout nature this primary figure is repeated without end. It
is the highest emblem in the cipher of the world. St. Augustine
described the nature of God as a circle whose centre was everywhere
and its circumference nowhere. We are all our lifetime reading the
copious sense of this first of forms. One moral we have already
deduced in considering the circular or compensatory character of every
human action. Another analogy we shall now trace, that every action
admits of being outdone. Our life is an apprenticeship to the truth
that around every circle another can be drawn; that there is no end in
nature, but every end is a beginning; that there is always another
dawn risen on mid-noon, and under every deep a lower deep opens....</p>

<p>There are no fixtures in nature. The universe is fluid and volatile.
Permanence is but a word of degrees. Our globe, seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5446" id="Page_5446">[Pg 5446]</a></span> by God, is a
transparent law, not a mass of facts. The law dissolves the fact and
holds it fluid. Our culture is the predominance of an idea which draws
after it this train of cities and institutions. Let us rise into
another idea; they will disappear. The Greek sculpture is all melted
away as if it had been statues of ice; here and there a solitary
figure or fragment remaining, as we see flecks and scraps of snow left
in cold dells and mountain clefts in June and July. For the genius
that created it creates now somewhat else. The Greek letters last a
little longer, but are already passing under the same sentence and
tumbling into the inevitable pit which the creation of new thought
opens for all that is old. The new continents are built out of the
ruins of an old planet; the new races fed out of the decomposition of
the foregoing. New arts destroy the old. See the investment of capital
in aqueducts, made useless by hydraulics; fortifications by gunpowder;
roads and canals by railways; sails by steam; steam by electricity.</p>

<p>You admire this tower of granite, weathering the hurts of so many
ages. Yet a little waving hand built this huge wall, and that which
builds is better than that which is built. The hand that built can
topple it down much faster. Better than the hand and nimbler was the
invisible thought which wrought through it; and thus ever behind the
coarse effect is a fine cause, which, being narrowly seen, is itself
the effect of a finer cause. Everything looks permanent until its
secret is known. A rich estate appears to women and children a firm
and lasting fact; to a merchant, one easily created out of any
materials, and easily lost. An orchard, good tillage, good grounds,
seem a fixture like a gold mine, or a river, to a citizen; but to a
large farmer, not much more fixed than the state of the crop. Nature
looks provokingly stable and secular, but it has a cause like all the
rest; and when once I comprehend that, will these fields stretch so
immovably wide, these leaves hang so individually considerable?
Permanence is a word of degrees. Everything is medial. Moons are no
more bounds to spiritual power than bat-balls.</p>

<p>The key to every man is his thought. Sturdy and defying though he
look, he has a helm which he obeys, which is the idea after which all
his facts are classified. He can only be reformed by showing him a new
idea which commands his own. The life of man is a self-evolving
circle, which from a ring imperceptibly small, rushes on all sides
outwards to new and larger circles, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5447" id="Page_5447">[Pg 5447]</a></span> that without end. The extent
to which this generation of circles, wheel without wheel, will go,
depends on the force or truth of the individual soul. For it is the
inert effort of each thought, having formed itself into a circular
wave of circumstance,&mdash;as for instance an empire, rules of an art, a
local usage, a religious rite,&mdash;to heap itself on that ridge and to
solidify and hem in the life. But if the soul is quick and strong it
bursts over that boundary on all sides and expands another orbit on
the great deep, which also runs up into a high wave, with attempt
again to stop and to bind. But the heart refuses to be imprisoned; in
its first and narrowest pulses it already tends outward with a vast
force and to immense and innumerable expansions.</p>

<p>Every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series,&mdash;every general
law only a particular fact of some more general law presently to
disclose itself. There is no outside, no inclosing wall, no
circumference to us. The man finishes his story,&mdash;how good! how final!
how it puts a new face on all things! He fills the sky. Lo! on the
other side rises also a man and draws a circle around the circle we
had just pronounced the outline of the sphere. Then already is our
first speaker not man, but only a first speaker. His only redress is
forthwith to draw a circle outside of his antagonist. And so men do by
themselves. The result of to-day, which haunts the mind and cannot be
escaped, will presently be abridged into a word, and the principle
that seemed to explain nature will itself be included as one example
of a bolder generalization. In the thought of to-morrow there is a
power to upheave all thy creed, all the creeds, all the literatures of
the nations, and marshal thee to a heaven which no epic dream has yet
depicted. Every man is not so much a workman in the world as he is a
suggestion of that he should be. Men walk as prophecies of the next
age.</p>

<p>Step by step we scale this mysterious ladder; the steps are actions,
the new prospect is power. Every several result is threatened and
judged by that which follows. Every one seems to be contradicted by
the new; it is only limited by the new. The new statement is always
hated by the old, and to those dwelling in the old, comes like an
abyss of skepticism. But the eye soon gets wonted to it, for the eye
and it are effects of one cause; then its innocency and benefit
appear, and presently, all its energy spent, it pales and dwindles
before the revelation of the new hour.</p>

<h3><a name="SELFRELIANCE" id="SELFRELIANCE"></a>SELF-RELIANCE</h3>


<p>Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the
place the Divine providence has found for you, the society of your
contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done
so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age,
betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated
at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all
their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind
the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a
protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides,
redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort and advancing
on Chaos and the Dark.</p>

<p>What pretty oracles nature yields us on this text in the face and
behavior of children, babes, and even brutes! That divided and rebel
mind, that distrust of a sentiment because our arithmetic has computed
the strength and means opposed to our purpose, these have not. Their
mind being whole, their eye is as yet unconquered, and when we look in
their faces we are disconcerted. Infancy conforms to nobody; all
conform to it: so that one babe commonly makes four or five out of the
adults who prattle and play to it. So God has armed youth and puberty
and manhood no less with its own piquancy and charm, and made it
enviable and gracious and its claims not to be put by, if it will
stand by itself. Do not think the youth has no force, because he
cannot speak to you and me. Hark! in the next room the voice is
sufficiently clear and emphatic! It seems he knows how to speak to his
contemporaries. Bashful or bold then, he will know how to make us
seniors very unnecessary.</p>

<p>The nonchalance of boys who are sure of a dinner, and would disdain as
much as a lord to do or say aught to conciliate one, is the healthy
attitude of human nature. A boy is in the parlor what the pit is in
the play-house: independent, irresponsible, looking out from his
corner on such people and facts as pass by, he tries and sentences
them on their merits, in the swift summary way of boys, as good, bad,
interesting, silly, eloquent, troublesome. He cumbers himself never
about consequences, about interests; he gives an independent, genuine
verdict. You must court him; he does not court you. But the man is, as it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5449" id="Page_5449">[Pg 5449]</a></span>
were, clapped into jail by his consciousness. As soon as he has
once acted or spoken with &eacute;clat he is a committed person, watched by
the sympathy or the hatred of hundreds, whose affections must now
enter into his account. There is no Lethe for this. Ah, that he could
pass again into his neutrality! Who can thus avoid all pledges, and
having observed, observe again from the same unaffected, unbiased,
unbribable, unaffrighted innocence, must always be formidable. He
would utter opinions on all passing affairs, which being seen to be
not private but necessary, would sink like darts into the ear of men
and put them in fear.</p>

<p>These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint
and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in
conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is
a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better
securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty
and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity.
Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators,
but names and customs.</p>

<p>Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather
immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must
explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity
of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the
suffrage of the world. I remember an answer which when quite young I
was prompted to make to a valued adviser, who was wont to importune me
with the dear old doctrines of the Church. On my saying, "What have I
to do with the sacredness of traditions, if I live wholly from
within?" my friend suggested, "But these impulses may be from below,
not from above." I replied, "They do not seem to me to be such; but if
I am the Devil's child, I will live then from the Devil." No law can
be sacred to me but that of my nature. Good and bad are but names very
readily transferable to that or this: the only right is what is after
my constitution; the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry
himself in the presence of all opposition as if everything were
titular and ephemeral but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we
capitulate to badges and names, to large societies and dead
institutions. Every decent and well-spoken individual affects and
sways me more than is right. I ought to go upright and vital, and
speak the rude truth in all ways. If malice and vanity wear the coat of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5450" id="Page_5450">[Pg 5450]</a></span>
philanthropy, shall that pass? If an angry bigot assumes this
bountiful cause of Abolition, and comes to me with his last news from
Barbadoes, why should I not say to him:&mdash;"Go love thy infant; love thy
wood-chopper; be good-natured and modest; have that grace; and never
varnish your hard, uncharitable ambition with this incredible
tenderness for black folk a thousand miles off. Thy love afar is spite
at home." Rough and graceless would be such greeting, but truth is
handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some
edge to it, else it is none. The doctrine of hatred must be preached,
as the counteraction of the doctrine of love, when that pules and
whines. I shun father and mother and wife and brother when my genius
calls me. I would write on the lintels of the door-post, <i>Whim</i>. I
hope it is somewhat better than whim at last, but we cannot spend the
day in explanation. Expect me not to show cause why I seek or why I
exclude company. Then again, do not tell me, as a good man did to-day,
of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they <i>my</i>
poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the
dollar, the dime, the cent I give to such men as do not belong to me
and to whom I do not belong. There is a class of persons to whom by
all spiritual affinity I am bought and sold; for them I will go to
prison if need be: but your miscellaneous popular charities; the
education at college of fools; the building of meeting-houses to the
vain end to which many now stand; alms to sots, and the thousandfold
relief societies;&mdash;though I confess with shame I sometimes succumb and
give the dollar, it is a wicked dollar, which by-and-by I shall have
the manhood to withhold....</p>

<p>What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think.
This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life, may
serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is
the harder because you will always find those who think they know what
is your duty better than you know it. It is easy in the world to live
after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our
own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with
perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</p>

<h3><a name="HISTORY" id="HISTORY"></a>HISTORY</h3>

<p>Civil and natural history, the history of art and of literature, must
be explained from individual history, or must remain words, There is
nothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest us;
kingdom, college, tree, horse, or iron shoe,&mdash;the roots of all things
are in man. Santa Croce and the Dome of St. Peter's are lame copies
after a divine model. Strassburg Cathedral is a material counterpart
of the soul of Erwin of Steinbach. The true poem is the poet's mind;
the true ship is the ship-builder. In the man, could we lay him open,
we should see the reason for the last flourish and tendril of his
work; as every spine and tint in the sea-shell pre-exists in the
secreting organs of the fish. The whole of heraldry and of chivalry is
in courtesy. A man of fine manners shall pronounce your name with all
the ornament that titles of nobility could ever add.</p>

<p>The trivial experience of every day is always verifying some old
prediction to us, and converting into things the words and signs which
we had heard and seen without heed. A lady with whom I was riding in
the forest said to me that the woods always seemed to her <i>to wait</i>,
as if the genii who inhabited them suspended their deeds until the
wayfarer had passed onward; a thought which poetry has celebrated in
the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human
feet. The man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at
midnight, has been present like an archangel at the creation of light
and of the world. I remember one summer day in the fields, my
companion pointed out to me a broad cloud, which might extend a
quarter of a mile parallel to the horizon, quite accurately in the
form of a cherub as painted over churches,&mdash;a round block in the
centre, which it was easy to animate with eyes and mouth, supported on
either side by wide-stretched symmetrical wings. What appears once in
the atmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly the archetype
of that familiar ornament. I have seen in the sky a chain of summer
lightning which at once showed to me that the Greeks drew from nature
when they painted the thunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a
snowdrift along the sides of the stone wall, which obviously gave the
idea of the common architectural scroll to abut a tower.</p>

<p>By surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances we invent
anew the orders and the ornaments of architecture, as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5452" id="Page_5452">[Pg 5452]</a></span>
see how each people merely decorated its primitive abodes. The Doric temple
preserves the semblance of the wooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt.
The Chinese pagoda is plainly a Tartar tent. The Indian and Egyptian
temples still betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their
forefathers. "The custom of making houses and tombs in the living
rock," says Heeren in his 'Researches on the Ethiopians,' "determined
very naturally the principal character of the Nubian Egyptian
architecture to the colossal form which it assumed. In these caverns
already prepared by nature, the eye was accustomed to dwell on huge
shapes and masses, so that when art came to the assistance of nature
it could not move on a small scale without degrading itself. What
would statues of the usual size, or neat porches and wings, have been,
associated with those gigantic halls before which only Colossi could
sit as watchmen or lean on the pillars of the interior?"</p>

<p>The Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the
forest trees, with all their boughs, to a festal or solemn arcade; as
the bands about the cleft pillars still indicate the green withes that
tied them. No one can walk in a road cut through pine woods without
being struck with the architectural appearance of the grove,
especially in winter, when the barrenness of all other trees shows the
low arch of the Saxons. In the woods, in a winter afternoon one will
see as readily the origin of the stained-glass window, with which the
Gothic cathedrals are adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen
through the bare and crossing branches of the forest. Nor can any
lover of nature enter the old piles of Oxford and the English
cathedrals without feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the
builder, and that his chisel, his saw and plane still reproduced its
ferns, its spikes of flowers, its locust, elm, oak, pine, fir, and
spruce.</p>

<p>The Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone, subdued by the
insatiable demand of harmony in man. The mountain of granite blooms
into an eternal flower, with the lightness and delicate finish as well
as the aerial proportions and perspective of vegetable beauty.</p>

<p>In like manner all public facts are to be individualized, all private
facts are to be generalized. Then at once History becomes fluid and
true, and Biography deep and sublime.</p>

<span class="i0">For me, in showers, in sweeping showers, the Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Visits the valley;&mdash;break away the clouds,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bathe in the morn's soft and silvered air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But these young scholars who invade our hills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bold as the engineer who fells the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And traveling often in the cut he makes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love not the flower they pluck, and know it not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all their botany is Latin names.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old men studied magic in the flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And human fortunes in astronomy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And an omnipotence in chemistry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preferring things to names; for these were men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were unitarians of the united world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wheresoever their clear eye-beams fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They caught the footsteps of the SAME. Our eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are armed, but we are strangers to the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strangers to the mystic beast and bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strangers to the plant and to the mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The injured elements say, "Not in us;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night and day, ocean and continent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire, plant, and mineral say, "Not in us;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haughtily return us stare for stare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we invade them impiously for gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We devastate them unreligiously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coldly ask their pottage, not their love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore they shove us from them, yield to us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only what to our griping toil is due;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sweet affluence of love and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rich results of the divine consents<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5460" id="Page_5460">[Pg 5460]</a></span><span class="i0">Of man and earth, of world beloved and lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nectar and ambrosia, are withheld;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And pirates of the universe, shut out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily to a more thin and outward rind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And wide around, the marriage of the plants<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The surge of summer's beauty; dell and crag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hollow and lake, hillside and pine arcade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are touched with genius. Yonder ragged cliff<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through which at will our Indian rivulet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds mindful still of sannup and of squaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose pipe and arrow oft the plow unburies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here in pine houses built of new-fallen trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supplanters of the tribe, the farmers dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traveler, to thee perchance a tedious road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or it may be, a picture; to these men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landscape is an armory of powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, one by one, they know to draw and use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They harness beast, bird, insect, to their work;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They prove the virtues of each bed of rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like the chemist mid his loaded jars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw from each stratum its adapted use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drug their crops or weapon their arts withal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turn the frost upon their chemic heap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They set the wind to winnow pulse and grain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thank the spring-flood for its fertile slime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, on cheap summit-levels of the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slide with the sledge to inaccessible woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er meadows bottomless. So, year by year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fight the elements with elements<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(That one would say, meadow and forest walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transmuted in these men to rule their like),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the order in the field disclose<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5461" id="Page_5461">[Pg 5461]</a></span><span class="i0">What these strong masters wrote at large in miles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I followed in small copy in my acre;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cordial quality of pear or plum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascends as gladly in a single tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in broad orchards resonant with bees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every atom poises for itself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the whole. The gentle deities<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed me the lore of colors and of sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The innumerable tenements of beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The miracle of generative force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-reaching concords of astronomy<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Better, the link&egrave;d purpose of the whole,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the glad home plain-dealing Nature gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The polite found me impolite; the great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would mortify me, but in vain; for still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am a willow of the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loving the wind that bent me. All my hurts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My garden spade can heal. A woodland walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quest of river grapes, a mocking thrush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wild rose, or rock-loving columbine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salve my worst wounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thus the wood-gods murmured in my ear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dost love our manners? Canst thou silent lie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou, thy pride forgot, like nature pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the winter night's extinguished mood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou shine now, then darkle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And being latent, feel thyself no less?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, when the all-worshiped moon attracts the eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The river, hill, stems, foliage, are obscure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet envies none, none are unenviable."<br /></span>
